Both cryptocurrency markets and conventional equity markets have been influenced by these changes. This study aims to investigate the potential hedging and safe haven benefits of Bitcoin and Ethereum against risks in Asian emerging stock markets under various Covid-19 pandemic contexts including the onset of the pandemic, varying levels of panic, the extent of media attention, and sentiment analysis. Utilizing the dynamic correlation coefficients derived from the DCC-GARCH methodology, our analysis indicates that, both Bitcoin and Ethereum do not effectively serve as hedges or safe havens for major Asian emerging stock markets during the Covid-19 outbreak. These results remain robust during more extreme periods characterized by high panic, intense media attention, and negative sentiment. Nevertheless, an noteworthy exception is the case where Ethereum exhibits strong hedging properties specifically in the context of the Pakistan equity market. Recognizing these unique hedge and safe haven potential of cryptocurrencies can contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of investment strategies and risk management practices during periods of market turbulence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19; Cryptocurrency; Fintech; Hedge; Safe haven; Stock","","","","","","","","Ahmed W.M.A., Stock market reactions to upside and downside volatility of Bitcoin: A quantile analysis, North Am.

The computer can aid in diagnosis via computed tomography images like PCR. Deep learning and machine learning are popular methods, and their main contributions are COVID-19 detection and prediction. This work aimed to develop an AI-based early detection strategy for COVID-19 based on computed tomography images. The model was trained and tested using a dataset that includes CT images. The SARS-COV-2 dataset contains 2482 CT images of 210 patients from publicly available sources. The modified model demonstrated encouraging outcomes by greatly enhancing the sensitivity measure (95.82±1.75), which is an essential criterion for accurately detecting instances of COVID-19 infection. In addition, the model generated higher values for the accuracy metric (91.67±1.68), the specificity (88.08±3.72), the precision metric (87.51±3.27), the F1_score (91.43±1.55), and the area under the curve (91.98±1.55). Deep learning techniques significantly facilitate the early detection of COVID-19. Its use has the potential to improve clinical doctors' readiness and the management of pandemics. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

The most described entity is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, although rare cases of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy have been reported, mostly in the setting of severe disease. We present the first report of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy involving both eyes and following uncomplicated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Relevant literature is analyzed and discussed. Case Description: A 65-year-old man presented with severe painless visual loss beginning in the lower hemifield of the right eye and involving both eyes in the span of 24 hours. Visual acuity in the right eye was reduced to no light perception and to uncertain light perception in the left eye. He had recently recovered from COVID-19 which had manifested with mild respiratory symptoms that did not require medical treatment. Complete ophthalmological evaluation revealed no anomalies except for non-reactive pupils. As radiological investigations including contrast magnetic resonance and computer tomography did not reveal acute events bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy was hypothesized. As giant cell arteritis is an important cause of sequential ischemic neuropathy, high dose steroid treatment was carried out until temporal biopsy ruled out vasculitis. Steroid treatment was then slowly tapered over the course of 45 days. The patient had a history of carotid stroke and thrombophilia and blood pressure monitoring after the event revealed hypotensive episodes which led to the suspension of antihypertensive medication. At one-month follow-up, a slight improvement in visual functioning was observed, with the patient being able to count fingers with both eyes. This improvement was confirmed at two months. Fundus examination revealed pale optic discs, which confirmed the diagnosis of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Conclusions: COVID-19 can induce vascular occlusion through endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, we propose that lowering of systemic blood pressure, as reported following infection, might also contribute to or even instigate optic nerve ischemia. © AME Medical Journal.","case report; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); ischemic optic neuropathy (ION); posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION)","antihypertensive agent; antithrombocytic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; methylprednisolone; prednisone; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; aged; Article; blood pressure monitoring; blood vessel biopsy; body temperature measurement; case report; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease severity; drug dose titration; drug safety; drug withdrawal; eye examination; family support; fever; follow up; giant cell arteritis; hospital discharge; human; human tissue; hyperhomocysteinemia; hypotension; immunopathology; internal carotid artery occlusion; ischemic optic neuropathy; ischemic stroke; male; medical history; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; polyglobulinemia; posterior ischemic optic neuropathy; recurrent disease; respiratory tract disease; temporal artery biopsy; thrombophilia; treatment duration; visual acuity; visual impairment","","methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; prednisone, 53-03-2","","","","","Hayreh SS., Ischemic optic neuropathy, Prog Retin Eye Res, 28, pp. 34-62, (2009); Rho J, Dryden SC, McGuffey CD, Et al., A Case of NonArteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy with COVID-19, Cureus, 12, (2020); Yuksel B, Bicak F, Gumus F, Et al., Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy with Progressive Macular Ganglion Cell Atrophy due to COVID-19, Neuroophthalmology, 46, pp. 104-108, (2022); Moschetta L, Fasolino G, Kuijpers RW., Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy sequential to SARSCoV-2 virus pneumonia: preventable by endothelial protection?, BMJ Case Rep, 14, (2021); Golabchi K, Rezaee A, Aghadoost D, Et al., Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy as a rare manifestation of COVID-19: a case report, Future Virol, (2021); Babazadeh A, Barary M, Ebrahimpour S, Et al., Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy as an atypical feature of COVID-19: A case report, J Fr Ophtalmol, 45, pp. e171-e173, (2022); Sanoria A, Jain P, Arora R, Et al., Bilateral sequential nonarteritic optic neuropathy post-COVID-19, Indian J Ophthalmol, 70, pp. 676-679, (2022); Romozzi M, Amorelli G, Savastano MC, Et al., COVID-19 presenting as a non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, Eur J Ophthalmol, 33, pp. NP133-NP136, (2023); Sitaula S, Poudel A, Gajurel BP., Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in COVID-19 infection-A case report, Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep, 27, (2022); Shahri SHG, Abrishami M, Shayanfar H, Et al., Bilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and choroidal ischemia in a patient with COVID-19 infection, Clin Case Rep, 11, (2023); Selvaraj V, Sacchetti D, Finn A, Et al., Acute Vision Loss in a Patient with COVID-19, R I Med J (2013), 2020, 103, pp. 37-38; Kaushik KS, Acharya UV, Krupa L., Dual hit-Magnetic resonance imaging in concomitant anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy in a case of rhino-orbital mucormycosis and COVID-19, Indian J Ophthalmol, 70, pp. 300-301, (2022); Chen AH, Pakravan M, Charoenkijkajorn C, Et al., Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Following Recurrent COVID-19 in Prior Bilateral Sequential Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy, J Neuroophthalmol, 44, pp. e70-e72, (2024); Miller NR, Subramanian PS, Patel VR., Walsh & Hoyt’s Clinical Neuro-Ophthalmology: The Essentials, (2020); Kuhli-Hattenbach C, Scharrer I, Luchtenberg M, Et al., Selective thrombophilia screening of patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol, 247, pp. 485-490, (2009); Lee MH, Perl DP, Steiner J, Et al., Neurovascular injury with complement activation and inflammation in COVID-19, Brain, 145, pp. 2555-2568, (2022); Savastano A, Crincoli E, Savastano MC, Et al., Peripapillary Retinal Vascular Involvement in Early Post-COVID-19 Patients, J Clin Med, 9, (2020); Hayreh SS., Ischemic optic neuropathies-where are we now?, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol, 251, pp. 1873-1884, (2013); Briquez PS, Rouhani SJ, Yu J, Et al., Severe COVID-19 induces autoantibodies against angiotensin II that correlate with blood pressure dysregulation and disease severity, Sci Adv, 8, (2022); Lanzani C, Simonini M, Arcidiacono T, Et al., Role of blood pressure dysregulation on kidney and mortality outcomes in COVID-19.

In the present work, a case-study was conducted by comparing human hemoglobin (Hb) oligomerization upon autohemotherapy before and after COVID-19 infection. Structural changes of Hb exposed to different concentrations of ozone (40, 60, and 80 μg/ml) in whole blood, before COVID-19 infection, was compared to Hb exposed to the highest concentration of ozone (80 μg/ml) in whole blood, in the presence of two antioxidants, cinnamaldehyde (Cin) and phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA), after COVID-19 infection. The structural analyses in this study was performed using various techniques, including DPPH radical scavenging assay, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, UV–VIS absorption spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and molecular docking studies. The results showed that Hb oligomerization by ozone increased significantly after COVID-19 infection. In addition, at an ozone concentration of 80 μg/ml, the affinity of heme groups for globin chains and to oxygen molecules were shown to increase, whereas the stability of Hb decreased. In contrary, the addition of Cin and PEA prevented the adverse effects of ozone with PEA showing more efficacy in maintaining the native structure of Hb. Taken together, these results provided insights into the adverse effects of COVID-19 infection on Hb oligomerization and highlighted the importance of an individual's antioxidant capacity in protecting Hb from ozone, especially high ozone concentrations in autohemotherapy, and further emphasised the importance of personalising the concentration of ozone for patient administration, in order to provide a safe and effective autohemotherapy treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidants; Autohemotherapy; Cinnamaldehye; COVID-19; Ozone, Human hemoglobin; Phenyl ethyl alcohol","Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Hemoglobin; Oligomerization; Autohemotherapy; Cinnamaldehyde; Cinnamaldehye; Coronaviruses; Exposed to; Haemoglobins; Oligomerizations; Ozone, human hemoglobin; Phenyl ethyl alcohol; Whole blood; COVID-19","","","","","","","Firuzi O., Et al., Antioxidant therapy: current status and future prospects, Curr.

Though COVID-19 vaccines are recommended, ongoing surveillance is crucial due to potential unforeseen events. Evaluation of longterm effectiveness and safety and addressing emerging variants are vital. This study integrates systematic reviews to assess COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety comprehensively. Methods: This study was an umbrella review study on the feasibility and effectiveness of vaccines for COVID-19. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus, using MeSH terms and keywords related to COVID-19 vaccines. Inclusion criteria comprised peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses in English, focusing on feasibility and effectiveness. Exclusion criteria targeted non-systematic reviews exclusively on vaccine safety and duplicates. Two independent reviewers screened and resolved discrepancies. Data extraction included key details. Methodological quality was assessed using the ROBIS tool. Data synthesis involves narrative and, if applicable, quantitative synthesis (metaanalysis). Reporting followed PRISMA guidelines. Results: A total of 32 systematic reviews were included in the study, of which 20 also conducted a meta-analysis. The studies investigated in the included reviews ranged from 7 to 74. The included articles were conducted in various countries around the globe. The findings indicated that COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe and effective for individuals with various medical conditions. The overall risk of bias for the included studies was assessed as low risk. Conclusions: The study outcomes indicated that mRNA vaccines exhibit a higher incidence of adverse events but demonstrate greater efficacy. Conversely, inactivated and protein subunit vaccines are safer but exhibit lower efficiency. Moreover, the vaccine is considered safe for individuals with specific conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, solid organ transplant recipients, children, pregnant individuals, and those with hematologic problems. Ultimately, the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among individuals is influenced by various factors, including geographic, socioeconomic, and pandemic-related considerations. © This open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial 3.0 License (CC BY-NC 3.0).","COVID-19; Effectiveness; Feasibility; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines","ad26 covid 2 s; bbibp corv; chadox1; coronavac; covilo; elasomeran; ibacovavec; mrna 1273; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; tozinameran; vaxzevria; antibody production; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug safety; feasibility study; human; humoral immunity; infection prevention; meta analysis; outcome assessment; Review; risk benefit analysis; seroconversion; systematic review; vaccination; virus transmission","","elasomeran, 2430046-03-8, 2457298-05-2; ibacovavec, 2541607-46-7; tozinameran, 2417899-77-3; vaxzevria, 2420395-83-9","ad26 covid 2 s, Janssen; ad26 covid 2 s, Johnson and Johnson; bbibp corv, Sinopharm; bnt 162b2, BioNTech; bnt 162b2, Pfizer; chadox1, Astra Zeneca; chadox1, Oxford; coronavac, Sinovac; mrna 1273, Moderna","Astra Zeneca; BioNTech; Janssen; Johnson and Johnson; Moderna; Oxford; Pfizer; Sinopharm; Sinovac","","","Mehraeen E, Dadras O, Afsahi AM, Karimi A, Pour MM, Mirzapour P, Et al., Vaccines for COVID-19: A Systematic Review of Feasibility and Effectiveness, Infectious disorders drug targets, 22, 2, (2022); SeyedAlinaghi S, Karimi A, Barzegary A, Mojdeganlou H, Vahedi F, Mirghaderi SP, Et al., COVID-19 mortality in patients with immunodeficiency and its predictors: a systematic review, 27, 1, (2022); Collier A-rY, Yu J, McMahan K, Liu J, Chandrashekar A, Maron JS, Et al., Differential kinetics of immune responses elicited by Covid-19 vaccines, New England Journal of Medicine, 385, 21, pp. 2010-2012, (2021); Shreyas Madhav A, Rajaraman R, Harini S, Kiliroor CC., Application of artificial intelligence to enhance collection of E-waste: A potential solution for household WEEE collection and segregation in India, Waste Management & Research, 40, 7, pp. 1047-1053, (2022); Dong Y, Dai T, Wei Y, Zhang L, Zheng M, Zhou F., A systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, Signal transduction and targeted therapy, 5, 1, (2020); Pormohammad A, Zarei M, Ghorbani S, Mohammadi M, Razizadeh MH, Turner DL, Et al., Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, Vaccines, 9, 5, (2021); Larijani MS, Ashrafian F, Amiri FB, Banifazl M, Bavand A, Karami A, Et al., Characterization of long COVID-19 manifestations and its associated factors: A prospective cohort study from Iran, Microbial pathogenesis, 169, (2022); Sharif N, Alzahrani KJ, Ahmed SN, Dey SK., Efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic reviewand meta-analysis, Frontiers in immunology, 12, (2021); Mehraeen E, Oliaei S, SeyedAlinaghi S, Karimi A, Mirzapour P, Afsahi AM, Et al., COVID-19 in Pediatrics: A Systematic Review of Current Knowledge and Practice, Infectious disorders drug targets, 22, 5, pp. 47-57, (2022); Garcia-Beltran WF, Denis KJS, Hoelzemer A, Lam EC, Nitido AD, Sheehan ML, Et al., mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine boosters induce neutralizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, Cell, 185, 3, pp. 457-466, (2022); Logunov DY, Dolzhikova IV, Zubkova OV, Tukhvatulin AI, Shcheblyakov DV, Dzharullaeva AS, Et al., Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia, The Lancet, 396, pp. 887-897, (2020); Zhu F-C, Guan X-H, Li Y-H, Huang J-Y, Jiang T, Hou LH, Et al., Immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 years or older: a randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, The Lancet, 396, 10249, pp. 479-488, (2020); Ramasamy MN, Minassian AM, Ewer KJ, Flaxman AL, Folegatti PM, Owens DR, Et al., Safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine administered in a prime-boost regimen in young and old adults (COV002): a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial, The Lancet, 396, 10267, pp. 1979-1993, (2020); BRISTOL Uo.

Aims: To investigate the factors influencing asthma control. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in the city of Guelmim, southern Morocco, during the year 2023. It included 118 patients with asthma, and health professionals administered a questionnaire based on the recommendations of the Global Asthma Initiative 2021. Results: Age between 38 and 48 years, non-smoking status, and living in a sunny, ventilated house were negatively associated with uncontrolled asthma and acted as protective factors. The absence of a history of COVID-19, strong adherence to treatment and the use of natural honey combined with medicinal plants were negatively associated with uncontrolled asthma. The presence of comorbidities, allergic rhinitis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dyspnea, and nocturnal cough were identified as risk factors for uncontrolled asthma. In multivariate analysis, age 38 to 48 years (adjusted OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.20), ventilated and sunny homes (adjusted OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33 to 2.10), no exposure to air pollutants (adjusted OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.50-6. 85), high adherence to treatment (adjusted OR: 0. 10, 95% CI: 0.10-1.20), comorbidities (adjusted OR: 2.74, 95% CI: 0.99-10.22), COPD and use of natural honey combined with herbs (adjusted OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.5-3.45) remained significantly associated with asthma control. Conclusions: The study highlights the need for comprehensive asthma management strategies that include medical treatment, socioeconomic factors, and environmental exposures. © 2025 Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacognosy Research.","asthma control; behavioral factors; clinical factors; epidemiology; risk factors","allergen; adult; Africa; air pollutant; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; Asthma Control Questionnaire; behavior; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; environmental exposure; environmental factor; female; gastroesophageal reflux; honey; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; medicinal plant; Morocco; observational study; patient compliance; people by smoking status; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk factor; socioeconomics","","","","","","","Adeloye D, Chan KY, Rudan I, Campbell H, An estimate of asthma prevalence in Africa: a systematic analysis, Croat Med J, 54, 6, pp. 519-531, (2013); Albataineh E, Al-Zayadneh E, Al-Shagahin H, Al Soloman A, Altarawneh A, Aldmour I, Asthma control and its predictive factors in adult asthma patients, J Clin Med Res, 11, 12, pp. 807-817, (2019); Al-Qerem W, Jarab A, Abu Heshmeh SR, Ling J, Variables associated with asthma control among adult patients, J Asthma, 60, 7, pp. 1290-1298, (2023); Amaral-Machado L, Oliveira WN, Moreira-Oliveira SS, Pereira DT, Alencar EN, Tsapis N, Egito EST, Use of natural products in asthma treatment, Evid Based Complement Alternat Med, 2020, (2020); Annesi-Maesano I, Oryszczyn MP, Raherison C, Kopferschmitt C, Pauli G, Taytard A, Tunon de Lara M, Vervloet D, Charpin D, Increased prevalence of asthma and allied diseases among active adolescent tobacco smokers after controlling for passive smoking exposure.

This study evaluates the MAGLUMI® SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein chemiluminescent immunoassay (MAG-CLIA) for its analytical performance and its role in predicting disease severity and prognosis among severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Methods: Analytical validation of plasma MAG-CLIA SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein encompassed precision, interference, LoQ and linearity. Plasma N protein concentrations and other biomarkers were measured within 48 h of admission, tracked until discharge or death. The Mann-Whitney U test explored the association between plasma N protein and COVID-19 severity or prognosis. Longitudinal monitoring of plasma N protein dynamics was conducted in representative patients. Results: MAG-CLIA demonstrated precise quantification of plasma N protein with a CV below 10 % and minimal interference. The LoQ was 0.88 ng/L, with a broad linear range. Plasma N protein showed high diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19, achieving 95.42 % specificity and 78.32 % sensitivity at 2.388 ng/L. Plasma N protein emerged as a valuable prognostic indicator, correlating with mechanical ventilation need and patient survival. Plasma N protein concentrations ≥ 424.3 ng/L (AUC 0.8102, sensitivity 78.38 %, specificity 85.48 %) were associated with poor prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Conclusions: MAG-CLIA's SARS-CoV-2 N protein detection in plasma demonstrates both analytical reliability and clinical relevance in our inaugural evaluation. As a promising prognostic biomarker for severe COVID-19 patients, it offers crucial insights into disease severity and progression, emphasizing the significance of early monitoring and intervention, especially for patients with comorbidities. © 2024","Chemiluminescent immunoassay; Comorbidity; COVID-19 prognosis; Mechanical ventilation; SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein","amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; D dimer; hemoglobin; heparin binding protein; interleukin 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; nucleocapsid protein; serum amyloid A; tumor necrosis factor; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; plasma; protein analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; severity of illness index","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; interleukin 8, 114308-91-7","","","Huashan Hospital North; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (HS2021SHZX001); Shanghai Public Health System, (GWV-10.1-XK4); Fudan University, (HSBY2019020)","This study was supported by Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (grant no.

Despite effective at early stage, long-term treatment with glucocorticoids can lead to a variety of adverse effects and limited benefits. The Chinese traditional herb Pogostemonis Herba is the aerial part of Pogostemon Cablin (Blanco) Benth., which has potent antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. It was used widely for treating various throat and respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, viral infection, cough, allergic asthma, acute lung injury and lung cancer. Aim of the study: To investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of chemical compounds from Pogostemonis Herba in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-overexpressing mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and hACE2 transgenic mice. Materials and methods: The hACE2-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells were exposed with SARS-CoV-2. The cell viability was detected by CCK8 assay and cell apoptotic rate was by flow cytometric assay. The expressions of macrophage M1 phenotype markers (TNF-α and IL-6) and M2 markers (IL-10 and Arg-1) as well as the viral loads were detected by qPCR. The mice were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant to induce viral pneumonia. The levels of macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells in the lung tissues of infected mice were analyzed by full spectrum flow cytometry. The expressions of key proteins were detected by Western blot assay. Results: Diosmetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (DG) presented the strongest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Intervention with DG at the concentrations of 0.625–2.5 μM not only reduced the viral replication, cell apoptosis, and the productions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) in SARS-CoV-2-infected RAW264.7 cells, but also reversed macrophage polarity from M1 to M2 phenotype. Furthermore, treatment with DG (25–100 mg/kg) alleviated acute lung injury, and reduced macrophage infiltration in SARS-COV-2-infected mice. Mechanistically, DG inhibited SARS-COV-2 gene expression and HK3 translation via targeting YTHDF1, resulting in the inactivation of glycolysis-mediated NF-κB pathway. Conclusions: DG exerted the potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. It reduced pneumonia in SARS-COV-2-infected mice via inhibiting the viral replication and accelerating M2 macrophage polarization via targeting YTHDF1, indicating its potential for COVID-19 treatment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Apigenin (pubchem CID: 5280443); Apigenin-7-glucoside (pubchem CID: 5280704); Diosmetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (pubchem CID: 11016019); Glycolysis; HK3; Luteolin (pubchem CID: 5280445); Luteolin-7-glucoside (pubchem CID: 5280637); Macrophage polarization; Ombuin (pubchem CID: 5320287); Quercetin (pubchem CID: 5280343); Remdesivir (pubchem CID: 121304016); Tilianin (pubchem CID: 5321954); Velutin (pubchem CID: 5464381); Viral replication; Vitexin (pubchem CID: 5280441); YTHDF1","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antiviral Agents; Apoptosis; COVID-19; COVID-19 Drug Treatment; Cytokines; Flavonoids; Glucosides; Humans; Lung; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Pneumonia, Viral; Pogostemon; RAW 264.7 Cells; SARS-CoV-2; Virus Replication; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; antiinflammatory agent; apigenin; apigetrin; arginase 1; caspase 3; caspase 9; diosmetin 7 o beta glucopyranoside; flavonoid; flavonoid glycoside; herbaceous agent; hexokinase; hexokinase 3; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; luteolin; luteolin 7 glucoside; messenger RNA; ombuin; phenol derivative; protein; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; quercetin; reactive oxygen metabolite; remdesivir; RNA binding protein; terpene derivative; tilianin; transcription factor RelA; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; velutin; vitexin; YTH m6A RNA binding protein 1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; cytokine; flavonoid; glucoside; acute lung injury; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; antiviral activity; apoptosis; apoptosis rate; Article; BEAS-2B cell line; cell infiltration; cell viability; controlled study; COVID-19 pneumonia; cytokine production; down regulation; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug targeting; ethnopharmacology; flow cytometry; fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction; gene expression regulation; gene inactivation; gene overexpression; glycolysis; human; human cell; IC50; immunophenotyping; inflammation; low drug dose; lung parenchyma; M1 macrophage; M2 macrophage; macrophage function; macrophage polarization; male; molecular docking; mouse; mRNA expression level; neutrophil; NF kB signaling; nonhuman; Pogostemon cablin; protein expression level; RAW 264.7 cell line; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; T lymphocyte; therapy effect; transgenic mouse; virus load; virus replication; Western blotting; animal; chemistry; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 pharmacotherapy; drug effect; drug therapy; isolation and purification; lung; macrophage; metabolism; pathology; Pogostemon; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus pneumonia","","apigenin, 520-36-5; apigetrin, 28629-51-8, 33908-68-8; caspase 3, 169592-56-7; caspase 9, 180189-96-2; hexokinase, 9001-51-8; luteolin, 491-70-3; luteolin 7 glucoside, 5373-11-5; protein, 67254-75-5; protein bcl 2, 219306-68-0; quercetin, 117-39-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; vitexin, 3681-93-4; glucoside, 50986-29-3; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, ; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, ; Antiviral Agents, ; Cytokines, ; Flavonoids, ; Glucosides, ","","","Huadong Medicine Joint Funds of the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, (LHDMZ22H300009); Hangzhou Medical College, (KYZD202106); Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province, (LGF21H280006); Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province","This work is supported by Huadong Medicine Joint Funds of the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No. LHDMZ22H300009), Key research projects of Hangzhou Medical College (No. KYZD202106), and Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province (No. LGF21H280006).

In the crystalline state, molecules of 1 exhibited C–H···O intramolecular bonds and produced a 1D chain through N–H···N and C–H···N contacts. Chains produce a supramolecular 2D layer due to π···π interactions. In the UV–vis spectrum, 1 exhibits bands up to ∼360 nm and is emissive with a broad band from about 335 to 450 nm, with the maximum at 365 nm. Fine features of 1 were revealed using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations in water. The computed geometrical parameters are in accordance with the experimental values. The frontier electronic orbitals were found on the molecule except for the propyl fragment, and 1 was determined as a strong electrophile. The computed absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) features predicted positive gastrointestinal absorption (GA) activity and negative human blood-brain barrier (BBB) property of 1. Compound 1 in silico tested to inhibit some of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins. Papain-like protease (PLpro) and Nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3_range 207–379-MES) were established to interact with 1 more efficiently. The PLpro complex with 1 exhibits a ligand efficiency scores for a Hit. The present study also delved into elucidating the cytotoxic potential of compound 1 in Dalton's Lymphoma (DL) malignant cancer cell lines, aiming to explore its anticancer efficacy. Furthermore, this investigation extends its purview to scrutinize the cytotoxicity profile of the aforementioned compound on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thus enabling a comprehensive comparative analysis of cellular responses under both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell lines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Anticancer agent; COVID-19; Naphthyridine; Tetrazole; Theoretical computations; X-ray analysis","Coronavirus; Elastomers; Ionomers; Ligands; Papain; Silicones; 1D chain; Anti-cancer agents; Anticancer activities; Butyramide; Crystalline state; Intramolecular bonds; Naphthyridine; State molecules; Tetrazoles; Theoretical computation; X ray diffraction analysis","","","","","","","Koller G., Über das 1.8-naphthyridin, Berichte, 60, pp. 1918-1920, (1927); Ikekawa N., Studies on naphthyridines.

We investigated interoceptive mechanisms in COVID-19 survivors focusing on their potential link with psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: We assessed interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and time-perceiving (TA) skills of 57 COVID-19 survivors one month after hospital discharge through, respectively, a heartbeats perception task and a time duration task. Each participant was assessed about his interoceptive awareness (IAw) through Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (MAIA) and then, screened for post-traumatic (Impact of Events Scale – IES-R), anxious (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory – STAI-Y1) and depressive (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale - ZSDS; Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-13) symptoms. Biomarkers of inflammation (platelet count, PC; mean platelet volume, MPV and systemic immune-inflammation index, SII) were obtained in a subsample of 40 survivors by a blood sampling conducted at admission and discharge time from the hospital. Correlational, GLM, GLMZ, and mediation analyses were performed. Results: IAc did not correlate with TA confirming the reliability of interoceptive measure. IAc positively predicts MAIA's Trusting subscale and negatively predicts anxious psychopathology which fully mediates the effect of IAc on Trusting.PC at hospital admission predicts anxiety at one month after recovery. Again, a higher decrease of SII during hospitalization predicts higher IAc skill and lower anxiety state at one month. The link between SII change and anxiety is fully mediated by IAc. Conclusions: Our results unveil a potential key role of interoception and brain-body interchange in the exacerbation and maintenance of anxiety psychopathology in COVID-19 survivors. © 2024","Anxiety; COVID-19; Inflammatory biomarkers; Interoceptive accuracy; Interoceptive awareness","biological marker; C reactive protein; adult; anxiety; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; blood cell count; blood sampling; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; depression; female; follow up; heart rhythm; hospital discharge; human; impact of event scale-revised; inflammation; leukocyte count; lymphocyte; major clinical study; male; mean platelet volume; mental disease; middle aged; multidimensional assessment of Interoceptive awareness questionnaire; nasopharyngeal swab; neutrophil; noninvasive ventilation; platelet count; questionnaire; real time polymerase chain reaction; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; survivor; throat swab; Zung Self Rating Depression Scale","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4","Pocess v.3.5; StatSoft Statistica 12, StatSoft, United States; statistical package for social science v23.0, IBM","IBM; StatSoft, United States","","","Datta S.D., Talwar A., Lee J.T., A proposed framework and timeline ofthe spectrum of disease due to SARS-CoV-2.

Within the PH spectrum, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) stands out with its primary pulmonary vasculopathy. PAH's prevalence varies from 0.4 to 1.4 per 100,000 individuals and is associated with diverse conditions, including viral infections such as HIV. Notably, recent observations highlight an increased occurrence of PAH among COVID-19 patients, even in the absence of pre-existing cardiopulmonary disorders. While current treatments offer partial relief, there's a pressing need for innovative therapeutic strategies, among which mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their derivatives hold promise. This review critically evaluates recent investigations into viral-induced PAH, encompassing pathogens like human immunodeficiency virus, herpesvirus, Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis B and C viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERKV), with a specific emphasis on mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we explore the underlying rationale driving novel therapeutic modalities, including MSCs, extracellular vesicles, and mitochondrial interventions, within the framework of PAH management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Mesenchymal stromal cells; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Mitochondrial transplantation; Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Viral infection","coronavirus disease 2019; Cytomegalovirus; drug therapy; etiology; exosome; hepatitis B; human; Human endogenous retrovirus K; human tissue; hypertension; mesenchymal stroma cell; nonhuman; pathogenesis; prevalence; pulmonary artery; pulmonary hypertension; review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; therapy","","","","","","","Castillo-Galan S., Arenas G.A., Iturriaga R., Contribution of STIM-activated TRPC-ORAI channels in pulmonary hypertension induced by chronic sustained and intermittent hypoxia, Curr.

Abdurrahman Wahid, Pekalongan, Indonesia","The sudden shift to online remote learning prompted by COVID-19 plunged many Indonesian universities into chaos. They grappled with the daunting task of adjusting to remote teaching and learning, often with little to no prior experience. This was particularly challenging because most universities in Indonesia follow traditional methods, primarily conducting classes in person on campus. This study seeks to empirically explore the indirect effects of digital literacy on operational accounting competencies. Furthermore, it aims to investigate whether student engagement in online learning serves as a mediating variable in the relationship between digital literacy and operational competence among fifth and seventh-semester Accounting Sharia students at Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) KH Abdurrahman Wahid Pekalongan, Indonesia. The study generates survey data using a predesigned questionnaire completed by 113 students. Data are analyzed using descriptive analyses and PLS-SEM (Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling). The statistical test results indicate that (1) digital literacy has no direct positive significant effect on operational accounting competencies (2) digital literacy has a direct positive significant effect on online student engagement, (3) online student engagement has a direct effect on operational accounting competencies, and (4) digital literacy indirectly influences operational accounting competencies through student engagement in online learning. These findings suggest a full mediation model because digital literacy can enhance operational accounting competencies only if students have high engagement in online learning. © 2025, Malque Publishing.

Using a time-varying quantile-based framework and daily data from June 5, 2014 to December 10, 2023, the safe-haven role of credit VIX is confirmed irrespective of bond sector. The safe-haven property of credit VIX is pronounced for high-yield bonds which embed a high credit risk-premium. This result stands when taking into account interest rate volatility, as measured by the MOVE index. A time-varying analysis shows the persistence of credit VIX as a safe-haven for all bond sectors after the COVID-19 pandemic and during a high US interest-rate regime. Corporate bond investors and traders can use these findings to refine their investment and trading decisions and offset credit risk during both normal and turbulent periods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","CBOE credit VIX; COVID-19 outbreak; Cross-quantilograms and quantiles; Fed tightening cycle; High-yield sector bonds; Investment-grade sector bonds; Safe-haven","","","","","","","","Adra S., Menassa E., Uncertainty and corporate investments in response to the fed's dual shocks, Financ.

A stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of CATCH for increasing initiation and engagement in post-discharge medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment among hospital patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). The objective of this study was to identify facility characteristics that were associated with stronger performance of CATCH. Methods: This study used a mixed methods multiple-case study design. The six hospitals in the CATCH evaluation were each assigned a case rating according to intervention reach. Reach was considered high if ≥50 % of hospitalized OUD patients received an MOUD order. Cross-case rating comparison identified attributes of high-performing hospitals and inductive and deductive approaches were used to identify themes. Results: Higher-performing hospitals exhibited attributes that were generally absent in lower-performing hospitals, including (1) complete medical provider staffing; (2) designated office space and resources for CATCH; (3) existing integrated OUD treatment resources; and (4) limited overlap between the implementation period and COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Hospitals with attributes indicative of awareness and integration of OUD services into general care were generally higher performing than hospitals that had siloed OUD treatment programs. Future implementations of addiction consult services may benefit from an increased focus on hospital- and community-level buy-in and efforts to integrate MOUD treatment into general care. © 2024","Addiction consult service;

This waning of immunity has been described in modelling as a lower level of protection. This study incorporated fine-scale vaccine waning into modelling to predict the next surge of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In Hong Kong, the Omicron subvariant BA.2 caused a significant epidemic wave between February and April 2022, which triggered high vaccination rates. About half a year later, a second outbreak, dominated by a combination of BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, began to spread. We developed mathematical equations to formulate continuous changes in vaccine boosting and waning based on empirical serological data. These equations were incorporated into a multi-strain discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed model. The daily number of reported cases during the first Omicron outbreak, with daily vaccination rates, the population mobility index and daily average temperature, were used to train the model. The model successfully predicted the size and timing of the second surge and the variant replacement by BA.4/5. It estimated 655,893 cumulative reported cases from June 1, 2022 to 31 October 2022, which was only 2.69% fewer than the observed cumulative number of 674,008. The model projected that increased vaccine protection (by larger vaccine coverage or no vaccine waning) would reduce the size of the second surge of BA.2 infections substantially but would allow more subsequent BA.4/5 infections. Increased vaccine coverage or greater vaccine protection can reduce the infection rate during certain periods when the immune-escape variants co-circulate; however, new immune-escape variants spread more by out-competing the previous strain. © 2024 The Authors","COVID-19; Discrete-time simulation; Epidemic model; Immune-escape; Waning immunity","chylomicron; Article; epidemic; Hong Kong; human; immunity; immunization; population; protection; sensitivity analysis; temperature; training; vaccination; virus transmission","","","","","Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局; University of Maryland School of Public Health, SPH; Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong, CityU, (7005523, 7005748, 7005876, 11203823)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from grants funded by the City University of Hong Kong [#7005523, #7005748 and #7005876] and the General Research Fund [#11203823] from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong.

In the Greek educational system, the Montessori method is mainly applied in preschool and primary educational contexts. The main research objective was to investigate the early mathematical competence of students aged 4-7 years old attending a Montessori preschool educational center with those of students aged 4-7 years old attending educational institutions where traditional teaching techniques and methods are being implemented at the Eastern Thessaloniki, Greece. The overall research sample was 142 students, 68 taught in the Montessori institution and 74 attending typical ones, as well as 119 parents of the children that were measured. A questionnaire was administered electronically to the parents who agreed to participate in the research, while the measurements of early mathematical competence were carried out via the Utrecht Early Mathematical Competence Scales. Overall findings showed that the scores of the students attending the Montessori educational institution were higher than those of the ones attending typical educational institutions, especially those of pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and first-grade children. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Methods: A three-wave study using a sample of 11 to 18-year-olds in China was conducted, with baseline data collected in June 2020 (n = 4156) and follow-ups in December 2020 (n = 3209) and August 2021 (n = 2324). Two temporal cross-lagged panel network models were computed to analyze adolescent learning burnout over time. Results: The predictive pathway of adolescent learning burnout demonstrates significant temporal specificity. In the early outbreak period, Positive thinking, Appreciation of life and Depression are the most influential predictive symptoms. In the normalized epidemic prevention period, Goal planning, Affect control and Positive thinking are the most influential predictive symptoms. However, during this period, the extent to which adolescent learning burnout is predicted by other symptoms in the networks is significantly reduced. Limitations: The samples used in this study are not expected to be nationally representative, and therefore the generalizability of the results may be limited. Conclusions: These findings highlight the predictive roles of Positive thinking, Appreciation of life, and Depression in adolescent learning burnout and the importance of timely intervention on these symptoms in the early outbreak period of public health emergency similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings also illustrate the essentiality of eliminate unstable factors in the school environment during the normalized epidemic prevention period. © 2024","Adolescent; CLPN; Depression; Learning burnout; Posttraumatic growth; Resilience","adolescent; adult; affect; Article; burnout; centrality index; child; China; Chinese; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross lagged panel network analysis; depression; epidemic; family support; female; follow up; goal planning; human; learning; longitudinal study; male; Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey; middle school; network analysis; pandemic; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; planning; positive thinking; Posttraumatic Growth Inventory; prediction; psychological resilience scale; Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescent; symptom; thinking","","","","","","","Ahola K., Hakanen J., Job strain, burnout, and depressive symptoms: a prospective study among dentists, J.

Thus, this study examines the interconnectedness of ESG emerging markets indices. To measure the spillover effects, we employ the Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) model and the time-varying parameter structural vector autoregression model (TPV-VAR). In addition, we analyze the potential influence of various risk factors, including economic policy uncertainty (EPU), the fear index (VIX), Brent oil, Daily Infectious Disease Equity Market Volatility Tracker (ID-EMV), and long-term interest rates (10YTB), on ESG connectedness. Our analysis is based on a dataset from November 2014 to February 2022, including the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Our results reveal significant spillovers among these markets, with the South African market playing a dominant role in transmitting and receiving shocks from other markets. Furthermore, we document the significant impact of various risk factors on the interconnectedness of ESG emerging markets. Our findings have pivotal implications for the risk of contagion in these markets, particularly during periods of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, our research provides valuable insights for investors, regulators, and policymakers seeking to promote sustainable investing and manage systemic risk in emerging markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Dynamic Connectedness; Emerging Markets; ESG; Risk Factors","","","","","","","","Aharon D.Y., Demir E., NFTs and asset class spillovers: Lessons from the period around the COVID-19 pandemic, Financ.

This study conducted comprehensive observations in Zhengzhou from April 26 to May 11, 2022. Low NOx concentrations were observed during the Covid epidemic period (EP) (10.4 ± 3.0 ppb), compared to the pre-epidemic period (PEP) (12.5 ± 3.8 ppb). The mean HONO concentration during EP (0.53 ± 0.34 ppb) was 0.09 ppb lower than that during PEP (0.62 ± 0.53 ppb). The decrease in HONO concentration during EP came mainly at night due to the reduction in the direct emission (Pemi) (0.03 ppb/hr), the homogeneous reaction between •OH and NO (POH+NO) (0.02 ppb/hr), and the heterogeneous conversion of NO2 on the ground (0.01 ppb/hr). Notably, there was no significant change in daytime HONO concentration. The daytime HONO budget indicated that the primary HONO sources during PEP were the nitrate photolysis (Pnitrate), followed by the POH+NO, Pemi, the photo-enhanced reaction of NO2 on the ground (Pground+hv) and aerosol surface (Paerosol+hv). The primary HONO sources were Pnitrate, POH+NO, Pemi, and Paerosol+hv during EP, respectively. The missing source has a high correlation with solar radiation, there might be other photo-related HONO sources or the contributions of photosensitized reactions were underestimated. In the extremely underestimated cases, HONO production rates from the Pnitrate, Pground+hv, and Paerosol+hv increased by 0.17, 0.10, and 0.10 ppb/hr during PEP, 0.23, 0.13, and 0.16 ppb/hr during EP, and Pnitrate was still the primary source during both PEP and EP. © 2024","COVID-19; HONO budget; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrous acid; Unknown sources","Air Pollutants; China; Cities; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; China; Henan; Zhengzhou; Budget control; Image enhancement; Nitrogen oxides; Photolysis; % reductions; Complex formations; Direct emissions; Formation mechanism; Homogeneous reaction; HONO budget; Megacities; Nitrous acid; NO x; Unknown source; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); COVID-19; megacity; nitrogen oxides; nitrous acid; air pollutant; China; city; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; human; pandemic; procedures; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19","","Air Pollutants, ","","","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2023M733220, 20220347A); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFC0212403); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2023M733220 ), the Zhengzhou PM2.5 and O3 Collaborative Control and Monitoring Project ( 20220347A ), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFC0212403 ).

This study included 88 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from Egypt. They were classified in to 3 groups with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 manifestation. Patients subjected to full history taking and clinical examination, CT scans of the chest, PCR test for Covid19 and blood sampling for vitamin D and Comprehensive inflammatory markers analysis. The present study reported statistically significant increase of age, dyspnea and respiratory rate (p <0.05) in sever infected groups than mild or moderate groups of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the primary analysis outcome was significantly associated mortality with reduced hemoglobin levels and elevated values of white blood cells, platelets, D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, blood urea and increased Prothrombin Time (p <0.05). However, insignificant statistical difference was found between the measured serum levels of Vitamin D in patients who recovered from those who died (96.58-± 38.34 vs 100.75 ± 80.62). This study concluded that COVID-19 severity correlates with multiple inflammatory biomarkers and coagulation factors. While the evidence concerning the therapeutic effect of vitamin D on the outcomes of acute respiratory infections is still controversial but a causal link between level of Vitamin D and the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality not entirely excluded. ©2025 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)","COVID-19; Inflammatory markers; Mortality; Patients; Vitamin D","","","","","","Department of Complementary Medicine; National Research Centre, NRC; Department of Hepatogastroenterology and Infectious Diseases; Faculty of Medicine Al -Azhar university","The authors would like to acknowledge with thanks all the staff of Zoonotic Disease, Department of Complementary Medicine, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt and Department of Hepatogastroenterology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine Al -Azhar university, Cairo, Egypt who provided help and support during the work.","Hassanain N.A., Hassanain M.A., Ahmed W.M., Shaapan R.M., Barakat A.M., El-Fadaly H.A., Public health importance of foodborne pathogens, World Journal Medical Science, 9, 4, pp. 208-222, (2013); Girh Z.M.S.A, Shaapan R.M., Overview of Aspergillosis in Poultry - A Review, Egyptian Journal of Veterinary Sciences, 55, 2, pp. 407-419, (2024); Toaleb N.I., Shaapan R.M., Zoonotic Protozoan Parasites Infecting Camels, Diagnosis and Control–A Review, Egyptian Journal of Veterinary Sciences, 55, 4, pp. 1131-1142, (2024); Abouelsoued D.M., Shaapan R.M., Elkhateeb R.M.M., Elnattat W.S., Hammam A.M., Therapeutic efficacy of ginger (Zingiber officinale), ginseng (Panax ginseng) and sage (Salvia officinalis) against Cryptosporidium parvum in experimentally infected mice, Egyptian Journal of Veterinary Sciences, 51, 2, pp. 241-251, (2020); Shaapan R.M., Toaleb N.I., Abdel-Rahman E.H., Detection of Toxoplasma gondii-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies in meat juice of beef, Iraqi Journal of Veterinary, 35, pp. 319-324, (2021); Hassanain M.A., Shaapan R.M., Khalil F.A.M., Sero-epidemiological value of some hydatid cyst antigen in diagnosis of human cystic echinococcosis, Journal of Parasitic Diseases, 40, 1, pp. 52-56, (2016); Mahmoud M.A., Ghazy A.A., Shaapan R.M., Review of diagnostic procedures and control of some viral diseases causing abortion and infertility in small ruminants in Egypt, Iraqi Journal of Veterinary Science, 35, pp. 513-521, (2021); Atta E.B., Ghazy A.A., Shaapan R.M., Equine Herpesvirus-1 Infection, Clinical Features, Treatment and Control, Advances in Animal and Veterinary Sciences, 8, 6, pp. 668-679, (2020); Salman M.B., Salah Eldin D.A., Zin Eldin A.I.A., Shaapan R.M., Ata E.B., Elaadli H., Prevalence, Virulence Determinants and Antimicrobial Resistance Genes of Staphylococcus aureus Strains Isolated from Retail Market Fish and Their Handlers in Egypt, Egyptian Journal of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, 28, 1, pp. 1101-1118, (2024); Shell W.S, Saad M.A., Abd El-Razik K.A., Sayedm M.L., Shaapan R.M., Brucella ovis as a Common Antigen for Rapid Diagnosis of Rough Brucellosis in Cattle and Sheep, Research Journal of Microbiology, 7, 1, pp. 68-74, (2012); Shaapan R.M., Hassanain M.A., Khalil F.A.M., Modified agglutination test for serologic survey of Toxoplasma gondii infection in goats and water buffaloes in Egypt, Research Journal of Parasitololgy, 5, pp. 13-17, (2010); Bardhan M., Ray I., Roy S., Bhatt P., Patel S., Asri S., Shariff S., Shree A., Mitra S., Roy P., Anand A., Emerging zoonotic diseases and COVID-19 pandemic: global Perspective and Indian Scenario, Annals of Medicine and Surgery, 85, pp. 3997-4004, (2023); Li Q., Guan X., Wu P., Wang X., Zhou L., Tong Y., Ren R., Leung K.S., Lau E.H., Wong J.Y., Xing X., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia, New England Journal of Medicine, 382, 13, pp. 1199-1207, (2020); Swenson K.E., Swenson E.R., Pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19 lung injury, Critical Care Clinics, 37, 4, pp. 749-776, (2021); Nile S.H., Nile A., Qiu J., Li L., Jia X., Kai G., COVID-19: Pathogenesis, cytokine storm and therapeutic potential of interferons, Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews, 53, pp. 66-70, (2020); Zayed N.E., Abbas A., Lutfy S.M., Criteria and potential predictors of severity in patients with COVID-19, The Egyptian Journal of Bronchology, 16, 1, (2022); Hou H., Zhang B., Huang H., Luo Y., Wu S., Tang G., Liu W., Mao L., Mao L., Wang F., Sun Z., Using IL-2R/lymphocytes for predicting the clinical progression of patients with COVID-19, Clinical & Experimental Immunology, 201, 1, pp. 76-84, (2020); Elfadaly H.A., Shaapan R.

As a result, interdisciplinary methods have become a requisite for numerous higher education actors and are likely to produce faster and more complex knowledge acquisition and research results, irrespective of the application field. Using the literature criticism method, we set the general framework and highlight the necessity of crossdisciplinary approaches to engage and prepare students and support scholarly endeavors. Following the experience-based learning methodology, we set the context for our case study approach derived from a digital humanities R&D project outlining its interdisciplinary learning potential with benefits for students studying sciences and humanities.

In the complex structure (Co1), the cobalt ion is in 2+ oxidation state and is coordinated with ONNO donor set on the thiosemicarbazone backbone. The complex molecule crystallizes in the space group P21/m and the environment of the cobalt center tends to square planar geometry. The inhibitory performance of SARS-CoV-2 and the anti-inflammatory impact of the complex molecule were investigated. It was found that Co1 has high inhibitory effects on the SARS-CoV-2 virus's 3CL main protease enzyme, ACE2:SARS-CoV2 Spike RBD interaction, and IL8. Also, it showed significant anti-inflammatory effects on the release of IL6, IL8, IL10, and TGFβ1 cytokines and wound healing during in vitro TNF-α-induced inflammation. Experimental evidence demonstrates that Co1 diminishes both IL8 gene expression and protein levels. According to in silico and experimental results, it has a drug potential. Assessing the in vivo impacts of Co1 might contribute to understanding its potential as an antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Cobalt; COVID19; IL8; Inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; Thiosemicarbazone","Antiviral agents; COVID-19; Gene expression; Anti-inflammatories; Anti-viral effects; Antivirals; Complex molecules; COVID19; IL8; Inflammation; Tetradentate; Thiosemicarbazone complexes; Thiosemicarbazones; SARS","","","","","Scientific and Technological Research Application and Research Center at Sinop University; Türkiye Sağlık Enstitüleri Başkanlığı, TÜSEB, (24482)","There is no conflict of interest for the writers.

Detecting the infectious part of the lungs using computerized tomography (CT) images has become an instantaneous detection method. In this article, a Hybrid Classification Optimization (HCO) using Recurrent Leaning and Fuzzy (RLF) is proposed. The neural network classifies infected and non-infected regions using pixel distributions and their variations. This is performed by identifying missing features and training the recurrent network using regional differences. Based on the feature availability, recurrent learning classifies the region through the input dataset and recurrent training correlation. The fuzzy predicts missing features through substituted derivatives obtained between wide ranges of variations. In this process, the maximum fuzzy derivatives for feature substitution are used for infected region prediction. The least fuzzy derivatives are prevented from the training layer to reduce false rates in region classification. This joint process improves the training consistency to leverage the detection and region classification accuracies. The proposed HCO-RLF improves detection and classification accuracy, and precision by 11.96 %, 9.98 %, and 13.42 % for the varying classification rates. Besides, the results are obtained in comparison with the existing DR-MIL, DSAE, and BS-FSA methods discussed later in the article. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","COVID detection; CT image; Feature extraction; Fuzzy derivatives; Recurrent network","Lung cancer; Classification accuracy; Computerized tomography images; COVID detection; Features extraction; Fuzzy derivatives; Hybrid classification; Missing features; Optimisations; Recurrent networks; Regions Classification; COVID-19","","","","","","","Sundaram S.G., Aloyuni S.A., Alharbi R.A., Alqahtani T., Sikkandar M.Y., Subbiah C., Deep transfer learning based unified framework for COVID19 classification and infection detection from chest X-ray images, Arab.

The geographical heterogeneity of HIV infection and the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of HIV at regional level are important to understand. This study aimed to estimate the HIV incidence by geographical region and understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced diagnosis of HIV. Methods: We used an extended back-calculation method to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of HIV/AIDS by geographical region. We used eight regions: Tokyo, the capital of Japan, Hokkaido plus Tohoku, Kanto plus Koshinetsu (excluding Tokyo), Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku plus Shikoku, and Kyushu plus Okinawa. Four different epidemiological measurements were evaluated: (i) estimated HIV incidence, (ii) estimated rate of diagnosis, (iii) number of undiagnosed HIV infections, and (iv) proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed. Results: The incidence of HIV/AIDS during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 increased in all regions except Kanto/Koshinetsu (51.3 cases/year), Tokyo (183.9 cases/year), Hokuriku (1.0 cases/year), and Tokai (43.1 cases/year). The proportion of HIV infections that had been diagnosed only exceeded 90% in Tokyo (91.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 90.6, 93.3), Kanto/Koshinetsu (91.0%, 95% CI: 87.3, 97.8), and Kinki (92.5%, 95% CI: 90.4, 95.9). The proportion of infections that had been diagnosed was estimated at 83.3% (95% CI: 75.1, 98.7) in Chugoku/Shikoku and 80.5% (95% CI: 73.9, 91.0) in Kyusyu/Okinawa. Conclusions: In urban regions with major metropolitan cities, including Tokyo, Kinki, and Kanto/Koshinetsu, the number of undiagnosed HIV infections is substantial. However, the proportion of undiagnosed infections was estimated to be smaller than in other regions. The diagnosed proportion was the lowest in Kyusyu/Okinawa (80.5%), followed by Chugoku/Shikoku and Hokkaido/Tohoku. The level of diagnosis in those regional prefectures may have been more influenced and damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic than in urban settings. © 2024 The Authors","AIDS; Community; Geographical variations; Heterogeneity; Incidence; Statistical estimation","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; antibody screening; Article; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; geographic distribution; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunoaffinity chromatography; immunofluorescence assay; incidence; incubation time; Japan; mathematical analysis; pandemic; Western blotting","","","","","Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, ERCA; Kao Health Science Research; Kyoto University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (21H03198, 22K19670); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, AMED, (JP23fk0108612, JP23fk0108685); Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, AMED; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJSC20U3, JPMJSC2105); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Yuai Welfare Foundation, (21HA2016, 20CA2024, 23HA2005, 20HA2007); Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society, RISTEX, (JPMJRS22B4); Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society, RISTEX; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund, (JPMEERF20S11804)","This study was supported by Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants (21HB1002 and 22HB1002).

Each crystal unit cell has four molecules. There are two piperidine rings: one in the chair conformation and another one in the boat conformation. The piperidine nitrogen in the boat conformation is joined to the oxygen-containing chair conformation piperidine ring to produce the oxaquinuclidine ring (-N-CH2O-). Furthermore, because of the steric barrier between rings, all aryl groups are oriented in an equatorial position. The crystal network is maintained through several interactions, including C—H⋯O/N/Cl/π. The crystal void and interaction energy studies gave additional evidence of the strength of the crystal packing and intermolecular linkage. Crystal 3b has less cavity than crystal 3c, indicating that it is densely packed. The dispersion energy contribution dominates the stability, according to the analysis of the electrostatic, dispersion, and total energy frameworks. Reduced density gradient (RDG), electron localization function (ELF), and localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis were used to determine the molecular interaction, electron pair density, and maximally localized orbitals overlapping sites, respectively. This approach reveals that oxaquinuclidine ring steric hindrance and the electron densities throughout the molecules. Density function theory (DFT) provides more evidence for the ring's orientation and the molecules' reactivity. A molecular docking investigation of four essential COVID-19 proteins was carried out using these theoretical ideas. This investigation demonstrates that each protein's reactivity varies; certain proteins have more interaction with high electron density molecules (electron-donating substituent), while others have more interaction with low electron density molecules (electron-withdrawing substituent). The ADMET and drug-likeness investigations reveal that methoxy group substituted molecules perfectly correlate with the required pharmacological characteristics. The cytotoxicity of the five compounds was assessed using the HEK293T cell. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 protein docking; Crystal structure; Hirshfeld surface; Interaction energy; NCI-RDG; Piperidine","Crystal orientation; Directed graphs; Drug interactions; Electron density measurement; Energy gap; Gels; Hydrometers; Isomers; Molecular docking; Molecular interactions; Molecular orbitals; Molecular orientation; Network theory (graphs); Photodissociation; Chair conformations; COVID-19 protein docking; Crystals structures; Hirshfeld surfaces; Interaction energies; NCI-reduced density gradient; Piperidine; Piperidine rings; Protein docking; Reduced density gradients; Conformations","","","","","","","Gates B., Responding to Covid-19-A Once-in-a-Century Pandemic, N.

Theoretical arguments and empirical findings suggest that videoconference interviews may lead to different interview performance ratings in comparison to Face-to-Face (FTF) interviews. This has led to the question of the comparability of the psychometric properties of videoconferences and FTF interviews. However, evidence from actual selection processes stems from the beginning of the century, and recent findings predominantly stem from simulated interview contexts. We present insights from an actual selection process within a large European organization where we had the unique opportunity for a quasi-experimental investigation of differences between videoconference and FTF interviews. Initially, the organization conducted FTF interviews, and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the interviews were conducted via videoconference. We examine mean differences in applicant performance ratings and evidence for response format-related validity differences. There were only small, non-significant mean differences and no evidence for response format related validity differences. We discuss possible causes for discrepancies in our findings compared to previous research. Furthermore, we conclude that downstream consequences of differences between FTF and videoconference interviews may be lower than previously expected. We end with a call for research on the interaction between technology-design and selection-tool-design features. © 2024 The Author(s).

It focuses on developing predictive models to forecast stock prices accurately, vital for mitigating losses and maximizing gains amidst the inherent unpredictability and volatility of the market. The study comprehensively analyzes various predictive models, including time series analysis and advanced machine learning techniques. It highlights the superiority of ensemble or hybrid models in enhancing prediction reliability. Central to this research is the development of a model incorporating detailed data collection, thorough analysis, and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, achieving notable predictive accuracy. This approach underscores the benefits of data-centric strategies in today's rapidly evolving business environment and the widespread applicability of predictive analytics. The model outperforms conventional methods by decomposing time series into simpler components and optimizing hyperparameters, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy, as demonstrated by performance testing on the S&P 500 and CSI 300 indices. The RMSE, MAE, and R2 values of the MEME-AO-LSTM model are 27.12, 19.43, and 0.992, respectively, which serve as evidence of this. The model's generalizability and high performance are demonstrated by its efficacy in a variety of major markets, including the NASDAQ 100, Nikkei 225, FTSE, DAX, SSE, and KOSPI. Additionally, the model's adaptability under diverse market conditions is demonstrated through its evaluation of its robustness in response to significant events, such as the economic stimulus responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical tensions resulting from the tension and conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Consequently, the proposed methodology has the potential to help investors achieve substantial and advantageous returns. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Aquila Optimizer; CSI 300; Financial Markets; Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition; S&P 500; Stock price","Adversarial machine learning; Prediction models; Predictive analytics; Aquila optimizer; CSI 300; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Hybrid model; Multivariate empirical mode decomposition; Optimizers; Predictive models; S&P 500; Stock market forecasting; Stock price; Marketplaces","","","","","","","Abualigah L., Yousri D., Abd Elaziz M., Ewees A.A., Al-qaness M.A.A., Gandomi A.H., Aquila Optimizer: A novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 157, (2021); Ahuja R., Kumar Y., Goyal S., Kaur S., Sachdeva R.K., Solanki V., Stock Price Prediction By Applying Machine Learning Techniques, International Conference on Emerging Smart Computing and Informatics (ESCI), 2023, pp. 1-5, (2023); Ali M., Khan D.M., Alshanbari H.M., El-Bagoury A.-A.-A.-H., Prediction of complex stock market data using an improved hybrid emd-lstm model, Applied Sciences, 13, 3, (2023); Andrada-Felix J., Fernandez-Rodriguez F., Sosvilla-Rivero S., A crisis like no other?

To control the imported epidemic, it is necessary to accurately predict the number of imported cases from different source countries. This paper proposes a novel time series prediction approach called PNICA (Prediction on Number of Imported CAses) that uses deep learning to predict the number of COVID-19 imported cases. On the one hand, the proposed PNICA approach adopts a multi-modal learning strategy to fuse three sources of data: flight data, the epidemic data, and the data of historical imported cases. On the other hand, the proposed PNICA approach extends the traditional transformer model with cross-modal attention to learn the interactions between different data modalities to improve prediction accuracy. We use China as the target country and collect the number of imported cases from four source countries—Japan, USA, Russia, and the UK—as well as the epidemic data and flight data from May to November 2020. Experiments on the collected data demonstrate that the proposed PNICA approach outperforms the baseline methods in predicting the number of imported cases. The ablation study shows that both the multi-modal learning strategy and cross-modal attention can significantly improve prediction performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Cross-modal attention;

Objective: to identify class or profiles of patients hospitalized and treated with COVID-19 pneumonia using latent class clustering methods to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of the resulting patients’ profiles. Poor prognosis was defined as death or need for ICU admission, good prognosis, the opposite. With special interest in differential responses to calcifediol. Setting: Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba Spain. Patients: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted for COVID-19. ClinicalTrials.gov public database (NCT05819918). Inclusion criteria: (i) Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 90 years, (ii) Pneumonia characterized by the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT scan, (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed, and (iv) CURB Scale 65 >1. Design: Latent class analysis, for obtaining homogeneous clusters, without specifying a priori the belonging group, and selecting the optimal number of clusters by minimizing information criteria. Evaluating the differences between groups for each variable by means of chi-square, Fisher's exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: 707 patients hospitalized from 10 March 2020 until 4 March 2022 were included. For the treatment variable, differences were found between class 3 (60 % treated with calcifediol only) and classes 1 (less than 1 % calcifediol only vs. 82 % treated with both), 2 (less than 1 % calcifediol only vs. 82 % treated with both) and 4 (1 % calcifediol only vs. 84 % treated with both). Class 3, (60 % with calcifediol), had a significantly better prognosis compared to patients treated with glucocorticoids alone (OR: 15.2, 95 % CI: [3.73–142], p<0.001) or no treatment (OR: 7.38, 95 % CI: [2.63–30.2], p<0.001). Conclusions: our real-life study shows that calcifediol treatment significantly reduces the need for ICU admission and improved prognosis in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in the profile of patients receiving it without glucocorticoids. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Calcifediol; Corticoids; COVID-19; COVID-treatment; Latent class analysis; SARS-CoV-2; Vitamin D","adalimumab; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; antibiotic agent; antithrombin; aspartate aminotransferase; azithromycin; bilirubin; C reactive protein; calcifediol; ceftriaxone; D dimer; dexamethasone; gamma glutamyltransferase; hydroxychloroquine; immunosuppressive agent; lactate dehydrogenase; methylprednisolone; procalcitonin; tocilizumab; adult; Article; Barthel index; bilirubin blood level; Charlson Comorbidity Index; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial (topic); controlled study; COVID-19 pneumonia; female; human; immunosuppressive treatment; intensive care unit; latent class analysis; major clinical study; male; neutrophil; observational study; prognosis; retrospective study; Spain; thorax radiography; x-ray computed tomography","","adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; antithrombin, 9000-94-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; calcifediol, 19356-17-3; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1, 104376-79-6; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; gamma glutamyltransferase, 85876-02-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5, 137433-23-9, 137433-24-0; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A, ; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9","","","","","Zhu N., Zhang D., Wang W., Li X., Yang B., Song J., Zhao X., Huang B., Shi W., Lu R., Niu P., Zhan F., Ma X., Wang D., Xu W., Wu G., Gao G.F., Tan W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019, N.

And it highly affects the most vulnerable groups such as women and children. This study explored the lived experiences of teacher-education student-mothers of a state university in the Philippines towards the end of the pandemic using a phenomenological approach. Twenty-one student-mothers voluntarily participated in the study who were i) bona fide students of the campus, ii) biological mothers, iii) married or living together with a partner, and iv) living with their child. From the data analyses, four major themes emerged: i) unexpected pregnancy, ii) heightened stress during the pandemic, iii) maintaining a positive outlook in life, and iv) managing dual roles. These results implied that the teacher-education student-mothers were highly stressed during the pandemic but they had extrinsic motivators to finish studies such as their children and family. The lived experiences of teacher-education student-mothers can serve as an inspiration to other students to pursue their studies even amid adversities. It is recommended that there must be an enhancement of student services tailored to support the mental health of marginalized students. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

However, uptake of influenza, pertussis and Covid-19 vaccinations offered during pregnancy is below the desired rate. This research aims to explore UK midwives’ experiences of approaching and discussing vaccinations with pregnant women, and their perceived role in pregnant women's vaccination decisions. Methods: Midwives in the West Midlands, UK were recruited via participating hospitals and midwife specific social media groups. Interviews were conducted remotely from April to July 2023 and analysed with a deductive codebook coding strategy using thematic analysis. Findings: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 midwives identifying the following key themes: Recommendations to have vaccinations reported on the contents of recommendations and how they are communicated; Messages and guidance included the importance of up-to-date informational needs for midwives to administer vaccinations and the barriers caused by uncertainty and conflicting messages about the Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy; Delivery of vaccinations included the convenience of offering vaccinations during standard antenatal appointments; and Midwives’ barriers explored the pandemic specific and other barriers midwives face in the administering of vaccinations. Discussion: These findings contribute to the understanding of how midwives discuss the topic of vaccinations with pregnant women. This research highlights the importance for midwives to receive clear and consistent information. A strong emphasis on why vaccines are important when recommending to pregnant women in addition to standard information on the availability and timing may have a bearing in helping women to make informed decisions about accepting vaccinations. © 2024 The Authors","Antenatal;

If the primary osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture is not treated promptly, it develops into an old osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with nonunion over time. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of percutaneous vertebroplasty in nine patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fracture with nonunion. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of nine elderly patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fractures with nonunion treated in the Orthopedics Department of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from September 2018 to August 2022. All patients underwent revision treatment with percutaneous vertebroplasty and received regular anti-osteoporosis treatment and rehabilitation training. The lumbar spine X-ray plain film and three-dimensional CT test results were reviewed before discharge and during follow-up to evaluate the diffusion of bone cement. Visual analog scale score, lumbar Oswestry disability index score, and Roussouly classification were recorded before, after surgery and during follow-up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) During postoperative follow-up, none of the 9 cases in this group experienced serious surgical complications such as nerve injury, infection, bone cement leakage, pulmonary embolism, and allergic shock, and no adverse reactions related to bone cement occurred. One patient died of respiratory failure due to COVID-19 infection 2 years after operation. (2) The visual analog scale score and Oswestry disability index score of postoperative pain in patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty were significantly lower than those before revision surgery. After the last follow-up percutaneous vertebroplasty revision surgery, the Roussouly classification of patients significantly improved. There was no statistically significant difference between the changes in vertebral body height during the last follow-up measurement and preoperative comparison. (3) These findings indicate that for patients with old osteoporotic lumbar compression fractures with nonunion, moderate injection of bone cement and effective dispersion of bone cement have a significant relieving effect on postoperative pain. Regular anti-osteoporosis and effective postoperative rehabilitation training can help patients improve their postoperative lumbar spine function. © 2025, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

This study analyzed the behaviors of 30 gym attendees to establish a connection between exercise intensity and virus exposure. Close interactions among participants were tracked using self-developed wearable devices that utilized computer vision technologies, while surface-contact behaviors were recorded using video cameras. A multi-route transmission model for respiratory infectious diseases was subsequently created, integrating the observed behaviors. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 served as a case study to evaluate infection risk via various transmission routes and to assess the efficacy of interventions. The METs during physical activity were about 3.5 times higher than those recorded at rest. The average interpersonal distance during close interactions in the gym was measured at 0.82 m, with 36.7 % of interactions occurring face-to-face. On average, the participants made contact with surfaces 770.3 times per hour, with 517.5 of these contacts involving public surfaces. The hourly infection rate was calculated at 18.5 %, with long-range airborne transmission and close contact accounting for 70.1 % and 28.5 % of the cases, respectively. To mitigate transmission risk, several intervention scenarios were modeled. These included (1) 100 % mask-wearing with N95 masks and occupancy reduced to 62 % (25 m2/person); (2) 100 % mask-wearing with surgical masks and occupancy reduced to 26 % (59.6 m2/person); (3) no mask-wearing, with occupancy reduced to 18 % (86.1 m2/person). All scenarios fulfilled the criteria for achieving an Rt below 1, indicating that under these conditions, gyms could be reopened safely. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Epidemic prevention and control; Gym; Human behavior; Metabolic equivalent (MET)","Lung cancer; Risk assessment; Case-studies; Epidemic prevention and control; Exercise intensity; Gym; High population density; Human behaviors; Infectious disease; Metabolic equivalent; Metabolic equivalents; Prevention and controls; COVID-19","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Wu W., Li Y., Li Y., An investigation of PM2. 5 concentration changes in Mid-Eastern China before and after COVID-19 outbreak, Environ.

Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the factors influencing the composition and diversity of AM. However, the knowledge of AM with anthropogenic activities has not reach a consensus. In this study, we took advantage of the dramatic decline of outdoor anthropogenic activities resulting from COVID-19 lockdown to reveal their associations. We collected airborne particulate matter before and during the lockdown period in two cities. The results showed that it was fungal diversity and communities but not bacteria obviously different between pre-lockdown and lockdown samples, suggesting that airborne fungi were more susceptible to anthropogenic activities than bacteria. However, after the implementation of lockdown, the co-occurrence networks of both bacterial and fungal community became more complex, which might be due to the variation of microbial sources. Furthermore, Mantel test and correlation analysis showed that air pollutants also partly contributed to microbial alterations. Airborne fungal community was more affected by air pollutants than bacterial community. Notably, some human pathogens like Nigrospora and Arthrinium were negatively correlated with air pollutants. Overall, our study highlighted the more impacts of anthropogenic activities on airborne fungal community than bacterial community and advanced the understanding of associations between anthropogenic activities and AM. © 2024","Air pollutants; Airborne microorganisms; Anthropogenic activities; COVID-19 lockdown; Response","Air Microbiology; Air Pollutants; Bacteria; China; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Fungi; Humans; Particulate Matter; Air pollution; Bacteria; Fungi; Air pollutants; Airborne microorganisms; Anthropogenic activity; Bacterial community; Community IS; COVID-19 lockdown; Environmental implications; Fungal community; Health implications; Response; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); COVID-19; particulate matter; source apportionment; air pollutant; bacterium; China; classification; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental monitoring; fungus; human; microbiology; particulate matter; COVID-19","","Air Pollutants, ; Particulate Matter, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31900106); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; East China University of Technology Practical Teaching Construction Project, (DHSY-202261)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31900106 ) and East China University of Technology Practical Teaching Construction Project ( DHSY-202261 )","Abdel Hameed A.A., Khoder M.I., Ibrahim Y.H., Saeed Y., Osman M.E., Ghanem S., Study on some factors affecting survivability of airborne fungi, Sci.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in sales of dietary supplements, including ginseng supplements, to purportedly support immune health and provide other health benefits. However, this heightened demand has subsequently increased the risk of adulteration in these dietary supplements. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a novel combination of DNA barcoding and multiplex PCR to identify species in ginseng supplements. A total of 50 commercial ginseng supplements containing Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, or Panax notoginseng were obtained from an online vendor. Two composite samples per product were subjected to DNA extraction followed by multiplex PCR and DNA barcoding with three genetic targets (i.e., rbcL, matK, and ITS2). Of the three DNA barcoding markers, ITS2 had the highest amplification success at 74%, and matK had the highest sequencing success at 60%. DNA barcoding alone identified species in 68% of products, while multiplex PCR had an overall 60% identification rate. The combination of both methods resulted in a 72% species identification rate. In addition to improving the overall identification rate, the combination of both methods allowed for greater species resolution and the detection of undeclared plant species. Future research should explore combining DNA-based methods with chemical-based approaches to improve ginseng detection capabilities and enable the quantification of undeclared adulterants. © 2024 The Authors","Adulteration; Dietary supplements; DNA barcoding; Ginseng; Multiplex PCR; Species identification","","","","","","","","Baeg I.H., The global ginseng market and Korean ginseng, Journal of Ginseng Culture, 4, pp. 1-12, (2022); Bauer T., Weller P., Hammes W.P., Hertel C., The effect of processing parameters on DNA degradation in food, European Food Research and Technology, 217, 4, pp. 338-343, (2003); Begg P., Wheatley V., Fraud in dietary supplements, Food fraud: A global threat with Public health and economic Consequence, pp. 351-360, (2021); Chen W., Balan P., Popovich D.G., Comparison of ginsenoside components of various tissues of New Zealand forest-grown Asian ginseng and American ginseng, Biomolecules, 10, 3, (2020); A DNA barcode for land plants, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106, 31, pp. 12794-12797, (2009); Chen S.-L., Yao H., Han J., Liu C., Song J., Shi L., Zhu Y., Ma X., Gao T., Pang X., Luo K., Li X., Jia X., Lin Y., Leon C., Validation of the ITS2 region as a novel DNA barcode for identifying medicinal plant species, PLoS One, 5, 1, (2010); Chen S.L., Yin X.M., Han J.P., Sun W., Yao H., Song J.Y., Li X.W., DNA barcoding in herbal medicine: Retrospective and prospective, Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis, 13, 5, pp. 431-441, (2023); Costion C., Ford A., Cross H., Crayn D., Harrington M., Lowe A., Plant DNA barcodes can accurately estimate species richness in poorly known floras, PLoS One, 6, 11, (2011); Fazekas A., Kuzmina M., Newmaster S., Hollingsworth P., DNA barcoding methods for land plants, Methods in Molecular Biology, 106, 31, pp. 223-252, (2012); Global Biodiversity information Facility, (2024); Guo H.B., Cui X.M., An N., Cai G.P., Sanchi ginseng (Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F.

Understanding this process is crucial for anticipating crises’ effects and implementing mitigative strategies. Specific economic sectors may be major crisis propagators: banking and insurance are often considered decisive in this context. This study employs Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model sectoral interdependencies within the U.S. economy, utilizing daily data from nine Dow Jones industrial indices over the period 2000–2020. As a secondary objective, we evaluate whether the insurance industry plays a central role in spreading crises. Several crisis periods are analyzed, from dot-com bubble to Covid-19 pandemic. The results reveal the subprime crisis, European debt crisis and the 2016 presidential election as the main contagious periods. The last analyzed period – Covid-19 pandemic – was divided in two phases, showing, on phase 1, an interconnected economic system with three main spreaders (Oil & Gas, Real Estate and Pharmaceutical) and, on phase 2, the same configuration of the post-subprime. Furthermore, although the insurance sector was somehow relevant during subprime crisis, it primarily acts as a contagion receptor, specially from the banking sector, with the correlation between them being the highest of all, reaching 0.49 at the last period. © 2024","Contagion;

A questionnaire was administered to 721 healthcare workers, with 411 from China and 310 from Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire assessed vocal-related symptoms, perceived voice handicap, frequently heard noise sources, and the quality of communications. The results revealed that the most frequently reported symptoms were ‘voice tiredness’ (20.5 %) and ‘clearing the throat’ (18.3 %). Specifically, 19.4 % of Chinese healthcare workers experienced voice-related symptoms, whereas only 6.3 % of Indonesians reported such symptoms. Longer working hours and working years were significantly associated with voice-related symptoms. Furthermore, the healthcare workers in China and Indonesia both reported mild (<30) voice disorders based on the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-30). Approximately one-fourth (23.8 %) of healthcare workers in China had VHI-30 scores exceeding 30, compared to only 7 % in Indonesia. The differences in vocal-related symptoms and voice handicap between the two countries were significant. Healthcare workers with 50–60 working hours per week exhibited higher scores than those working 40–50 h per week in both countries. Additionally, communication quality and the severity of voice problems for healthcare workers in China were worse than in Indonesia during the pandemic. © 2024 The Author(s)","Face mask; Healthcare workers; Noise; Pandemic; Voice handicap; voice handicap index (VHI)","Disabled persons; Face masks; Healthcare workers; Indonesia; Noise; Noise source; Pandemic; Voice disorders; Voice handicap; Voice handicap index; Working hours; COVID-19","","","","","","","Vilkman E., Voice problems at work: a challenge for occupational safety and health arrangement, Folia Phoniatr Logop, 52, 1-3, pp. 120-125, (2000); Melnyk P., Jamardo B., Cacace M., Pardo H., Pino A., pp. 1293-1296, (2003); Rosen D.C., Sataloff J.B., Sataloff R.T., Psychology of voice disorders, Plural Publishing, (2020); Bermudez de Alvear R.M., Baron F.J., Martinez-Arquero A.G., School teachers’ vocal use, risk factors, and voice disorder prevalence: guidelines to detect teachers with current voice problems, Folia Phoniatr Logop, 63, 4, pp. 209-215, (2011); Sampaio M.C., dos Reis E.J.F.B., Carvalho F.M., Porto L.A., Araujo T.M., Vocal effort and voice handicap among teachers, J Voice, 26, 6, pp. e15-820, (2012); Lloyd A.T., Gerhard J., Baker P., Lundy D.S., Diaz J., Bretl M.M., Et al., Prevalence of vocal fold pathologies among first-year singing students across genres, Laryngoscope, 130, 8, pp. 1996-2002, (2020); Sobol M., Sielska-Badurek E.M., Osuch-Wojcikiewicz E., Normative values for singing voice handicap index–systematic review and meta-analysis, Braz J Otorhinolaryngol, 86, pp. 497-501, (2020); Fasihat L., Qadeer A., Noor H.S., Khattak S.S., Voice disorders in lawyers; an analytical cross-sectional study in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, J Riphah College Rehabilit Sci, 11, 1, (2023); Merrill R.M., Anderson A.E., Sloan A., Quality of life indicators according to voice disorders and voice-related conditions, Laryngoscope, 121, 9, pp. 2004-2010, (2011); Servilha E.A.M., Leal R.D.O.F., Hidaka M.T.U., Occupational risks in the Brazilian labor legislation: highlight on those related to teacher's health and voice, Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia, 15, pp. 505-513, (2010); Verdolini K., Ramig L.O., Occupational risks for voice problems, Logoped Phoniatr Vocol, 26, 1, pp. 37-46, (2001); Busch-Vishniac I.J., West J.E., Barnhill C., Hunter T., Orellana D., Chivukula R., Noise levels in Johns Hopkins hospital, J Acoust Soc Am, 118, 6, pp. 3629-3645, (2005); Darbyshire J.L., Excessive noise in intensive care units, BMJ, 353, (2016); Song Z., Lee P.J., Hampton T., Acoustic environments of intensive care units during the COVID-19 pandemic, Appl Acoust, 199, (2022); Stringer B., Haines T.A., Oudyk J.D., Noisiness in operating theatres: nurses’ perceptions and potential difficulty communicating, J Perioper Pract, 18, 9, pp. 384-391, (2008); Song Z., Lee P.J., Voice use of nurses working in the intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic, Intensive and Critical Care Nursing, 82, (2024); Sala E., Laine A., Simberg S., Pentti J., Suonpaa J., The prevalence of voice disorders among day care center teachers compared with nurses: a questionnaire and clinical study, J Voice, 15, 3, pp. 413-423, (2001); Song Z., Lee P.J., Jung H., Prevalence of voice handicap among nurses in intensive care units due to occupational noise during pandemic, Front Public Health, 11, (2023); Abo-Hasseba A., Waaramaa T., Alku P., Geneid A., Difference in voice problems and noise reports between teachers of public and private schools in upper Egypt, J Voice, 31, 4, pp. e11-508, (2017); Heider C.A., Alvarez M.L., Fuentes-Lopez E., Gonzalez C.A., Leon N.I., Verastegui D.C., Badia P.I., Napolitano C.A., Prevalence of voice disorders in healthcare workers in the universal masking COVID-19 era, The Laryngoscope, 131, 4, pp. E1227-E1233, (2021); Lin Y., Cheng L., Wang Q., Xu W., Effects of medical masks on voice assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic, J Voice, (2021); Helidoni M.E., Murry T., Moschandreas J., Lionis C., Printza A., Velegrakis G.A., Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the voice handicap index into Greek, J Voice, 24, 2, pp. 221-227, (2010); Franic D.M., Bramlett R.E., Bothe A.C., Psychometric evaluation of disease specific quality of life instruments in voice disorders, J Voice, 19, 2, pp. 300-315, (2005); Hsiung M.-W., Lu P., Kang B.-H., Wang H.-W., Measurement and validation of the voice handicap index in voice-disordered patients in Taiwan, J Laryngol Otol, 117, 6, pp. 478-481, (2003); Lam P.K., Chan K.M., Ho W., Kwong E., Yiu E.M., Wei W.I., Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Chinese Voice Handicap Index-10, Laryngoscope, 116, 7, pp. 1192-1198, (2006); Sant'anna S.F.N., de Campos Duprat A., de Andrade M.A., M.F.d.Q.P.

Aim of the study: The study attempted to determine the therapeutic effect of SJD on LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as to investigate its mechanism of action and assess its therapeutic potential for the cure of inflammation-related diseases in the clinical setting. Materials and methods: We established an ALI model by tracheal drip LPS, and after the administration of SJD, we collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues of mice and examined the expression of inflammatory factors in them. In addition, we evaluated the effects of SJD on the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase –stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) and inflammasome by immunoblotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: We demonstrated that SJD was effective in alleviating LPS-induced ALI by suppressing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the BALF, improving the level of lung histopathology and the number of neutrophils, as well as decreasing the inflammatory factor-associated gene expression. Importantly, we found that SJD could inhibit multiple stimulus-driven activation of cGAS-STING and inflammasome. Further studies showed that the Chinese herbal medicines in SJD had no influence on the cGAS-STING pathway and inflammasome alone at the formulated dose. By increasing the concentration of these herbs, we observed inhibitory effects on the cGAS-STING pathway and inflammasome, and the effect exerted was maximal when the six herbs were combined, indicating that the synergistic effects among these herbs plays a crucial role in the anti-inflammatory effects of SJD. Conclusions: Our research demonstrated that SJD has a favorable protective effect against ALI, and its mechanism of effect may be associated with the synergistic effect exerted between six Chinese medicines to inhibit the cGAS-STING and inflammasome abnormal activation. These results are favorable for the wide application of SJD in the clinic as well as for the development of drugs for ALI from herbal formulas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Acute lung injury; cGAS-STING pathway; Inflammasome; Shuangdan Jiedu Decoction; Synergistic effect","Acute Lung Injury; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Disease Models, Animal; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Inflammasomes; Lipopolysaccharides; Lung; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nucleotidyltransferases; Signal Transduction; beta interferon; biological marker; CD11b antigen; Chinese drug; cytokine; dexamethasone; Forsythia fruit; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; Glycyrrhiza glabra root; glycyrrhizic acid; heat shock protein 90; inflammasome; interferon regulatory factor 3; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; interleukin 6; isg15 protein; lactate dehydrogenase; lamin B; moutan cortex; nigericin; p45 protein; protein p17; protein p20; radix paeoniae; radix paeoniae rubra; salvianolic acid B; unclassified drug; vadimezan; antiinflammatory agent; cGAS protein, mouse; herbaceous agent; inflammasome; lipopolysaccharide; membrane protein; nucleotidyltransferase; shufeng jiedu; Sting1 protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; bone marrow derived macrophage; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; cell viability; cGAS STING signaling; Chinese medicine; controlled study; cytokine release; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow cytometry; gene expression; high performance liquid chromatography; histopathology; immunoblotting; inflammatory cell; lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury; lung parenchyma; male; mouse; neutrophil count; nonhuman; Phellodendron chinense; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein blotting; real time polymerase chain reaction; Salvia miltiorrhiza; Scutellaria baicalensis; synergistic effect; therapy effect; Western blotting; acute lung injury; animal; C57BL mouse; cytology; disease model; drug effect; drug therapy; genetics; lung; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction","","dexamethasone, 50-02-2; gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; glycyrrhizic acid, 1405-86-3, 79165-06-3; interferon regulatory factor 3, 172493-30-0; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme, 122191-40-6, 187414-12-6; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A, ; nigericin, 28380-24-7; vadimezan, 117570-53-3; nucleotidyltransferase, 9031-50-9; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, ; cGAS protein, mouse, ; Drugs, Chinese Herbal, ; Inflammasomes, ; Lipopolysaccharides, ; Membrane Proteins, ; Nucleotidyltransferases, ; shufeng jiedu, ; Sting1 protein, mouse, ","","","DXM; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81721002, U23A20519, 82230118, 81930110); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2023YFC2308200); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (7232321, ZYYCXTD-C-202005); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","Funding text 1: Our results exhibited that SJD was effective in improving the extent of LPS-driven ALI lesions and ameliorating the alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and alveolar wall thickening caused by LPS. Also, in this study, we added HJD and DXM as positive controls, DXM, a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, has been determined to be useful in ameliorating LPS-induced ALI, and its mechanism of action might be relevant to affecting the NLRP3 inflammasome (Wan et al., 2021). HJD is a TCM formula that is clinically applied to cure patients with sepsis, septicemia, and lung inflammation (Li et al., 2022b). As shown in Fig. 1, the therapeutic impact of SJD on improving lung histology in the high-dose group was comparable to that of DXM and HJD. We also used qPCR assay to measure the level of inflammatory factors in lung that may be associated with the development of ALI, further supporting our conclusions. Importantly, for the collected alveolar lavage fluid, SJD was also effective in decreasing the number of neutrophils and the level of inflammatory factor expression in it. This showed that SJD has a favorable ameliorative effect on ALI in mice. HJD is commonly employed as a traditional clinical formula for alleviating conditions such as inflammation and diabetes. Clinical studies have shown that patients with pneumonia treated with HJD are well treated. Combining the results of Figs. 1 and 2, we believe that SJD and HJD have the same therapeutic effect in the treatment of ALI. On the other hand, DXM is a drug with a wide range of anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used to treat many inflammatory diseases such as acute ALI. In our study, we found that high-dose SJD had the same therapeutic effect as DXM, indicating that SJD could be a potential drug for treating ALI.This study was granted by the, Natural Science Foundation of Beijing, China (7,232,321), Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Central and local government administrators are facing a critical issue of resource utilization efficiency due to their limited resources. This paper employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the concept of an assurance region (AR) to assess the relative efficiency of administrative divisions in Taiwan, whose effectiveness has been praised by other countries’ administrators and citizens, regarding COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. The input factors used were the cumulative number of deaths (an undesirable factor) and expenditures, and the output factors were the average number of unconfirmed citizens aged 65 and older, the average number of unconfirmed citizens aged 0–64, and the cumulative number of vaccinations. Notably, because there are many COVID-19 variants with different characteristics, reaching a consensus AR among experts is difficult. Thus, different ARs were compared, and the most representative AR was identified for subsequent analysis. The main findings show that only Kaohsiung City was efficient, and Taipei City was the third worst due to inefficient operations. In addition, the administrative divisions were classified into four groups using cluster analysis based on the decomposition of aggregate efficiency to the contributions of the three outputs. The findings presented in this paper serve as a reference for both local government administrators and citizens, offering insights into relative efficiency and improvement directions. Moreover, they also provide guidance for resource allocation, future strategy adjustment, and development for central government administrators and citizens worldwide. © 2023 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","assurance region; cluster analysis; data envelopment analysis; efficiency","Cluster analysis; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Efficiency; Assurance region; Average numbers; Central government; Critical issues; Cumulative number; Empirical studies; Local government; Relative efficiency; Resources utilizations; Utilization efficiency; COVID-19","","","","","","","Adabavazeh N., Nikbakht M., Amirteimoori A., Envelopment analysis for global response to novel 2019 coronavirus-SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19), Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management Studies, 7, 2, pp. 1-35, (2020); Ahmad S., Masood S., Khan N.Z., Badruddin I.A., Ahmadian A., Khan Z.A., Khan A.H., Analysing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological health of people using fuzzy MCDM methods, Operations Research Perspectives, 10, (2023); Alekseev G., Amer S., Gopal M., Kuchler T., Schneider J.W., Stroebel J., Wernerfelt N., The effects of COVID-19 on US small businesses: evidence from owners, managers, and employees, Management Science, 69, 1, pp. 7-24, (2023); Atkins J.L., Masoli J.A., Delgado J., Pilling L.C., Kuo C.-L., Kuchel G.A., Melzer D., Tran B.X., Ha G.H., Nguyen L.H., Preexisting comorbidities predicting severe covid-19 in older adults in the UK Biobank community cohort, The Journals of Gerontology: Series A, 75, 11, pp. 2224-2230, (2020); Azadi M., Moghaddas Z., Saen R.F., Gunasekaran A., Mangla S.K., Ishizaka A., Using network data envelopment analysis to assess the sustainability and resilience of healthcare supply chains in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Annals of Operations Research, (2022); Aydin N., Yurdakul G., Assessing countries’ performances against COVID-19 via WSIDEA and machine learning algorithms, Applied Soft Computing, 97, (2020); Baltas K., Jayasekera R., Uddin G.S., Papadopoulos T., The role of resource orchestration in humanitarian operations: a COVID-19 case in the US healthcare, Annals of Operations Research, (2022); Banker R.D., Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Some models for estimating technical and scale inefficiencies in data envelopment analysis, Management Science, 30, 9, pp. 1078-1092, (1984); Bayram G., Yurtsever O., Efficiency evaluation of European countries in terms of Covid-19, International Journal of Advances in Engineering and Pure Sciences, 33, 3, pp. 366-375, (2021); Betthauser B.A., Bach-Mortensen A.M., Engzell P., A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature Human Behaviour, 7, 3, pp. 375-385, (2023); The COVID resilience ranking, (2022); Boubaker S., Le T.D., Ngo T., Managing bank performance under COVID-19: a novel inverse DEA efficiency approach, International Transactions in Operational Research, 30, 5, pp. 2436-2452, (2023); Bowlin W.F., Measurin g performance: an introduction to data envelopment analysis (DEA), Journal of Cost Analysis, 7, pp. 3-27, (1998); Financial stability report, (2022); Chang W.C., Lin C.Y., Taiwan's effective pandemic control with dialogic constitutionalism, Routledge Handbook of Law and the COVID-19 Pandemic, pp. 311-323, (2022); Charnes A., Cooper W.W., Rhodes E., Measuring efficiency of decision making units, European Journal of Operational Research, 2, pp. 429-444, (1978); Chen Y., How blockchain adoption affects supply chain sustainability in the fashion industry: a systematic review and case studies, International Transactions in Operational Research, 31, 6, pp. 3592-3620, (2024); Chen S.P., Chang C.W., Measuring the efficiency of university departments: an empirical study using data envelopment analysis and cluster analysis, Scientometrics, 126, 6, pp. 5263-5284, (2021); Chen Y., Zha Y., Wang D., Bi G., Online demand disruption in the presence of constrained capacity, International Transactions in Operational Research, 31, 4, pp. 2591-2612, (2024); Chien L.C., Bey C.K., Koenig K.L., Taiwan's successful COVID-19 mitigation and containment strategy: achieving quasi population immunity, 16, 2, pp. 434-437, (2022); Contardo C., Costa L., On the optimal layout of a dining room in the era of COVID-19 using mathematical optimization, International Transactions in Operational Research, 29, 6, pp. 3294-3315, (2022); Cook W.D., Zhu J., CAR-DEA: context-dependent assurance regions in DEA, Operations Research, 56, 1, pp. 69-78, (2008); Cook W.D., Zhu J., Output-specific input-assurance regions in DEA, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 62, 10, pp. 1881-1887, (2011); Cook W.D., Zhu J., Within-group common weights in DEA: an analysis of power plant efficiency, European Journal of Operational Research, 178, 1, pp. 207-216, (2007); Statistics: Table 3.

We experimentally studied the discharge characteristics of pharmaceutical excipients under vibrational excitation. The successful accurate dosing and filling of powders at fill rates of 0.6–15 mg/s was developed. A simple particle model includes fluid-grain coupling which is relevant to Faraday tilting resulting from gas trapped in the powder bed accurately predicts the discharge rate. A novel continuous micro mixing system was designed based on the discharge model. Any specified proportions can be realized by setting appropriate vibration parameters. The low variability (<2.5 %) in the content of components has verified the reliability of the mixing system. The continuous mixing performance was determined by the discharge characteristics. Yet the particle size distribution and cohesion lead to different mixing performances when the stability of micro feeding is satisfied. Reasonable process parameters for continuous mixing are determined and optimized. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Cohesive powders; Continuous manufacturing; Continuous mixing; Hopper discharge; Localized vibration","Cohesive powder; Continuous manufacturing; Continuous mixing; Discharge characteristics; Hopper discharges; Localised; Localized vibration; Mixing performance; Mixing system; Vibrational excitation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51876066); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Coal Gasification, (18DZ2283900)","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51876066 ) and the Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Coal Gasification ( 18DZ2283900 ).","Besenhard M.O., Faulhammer E., Fathollahi S., Reif G., Calzolari V., Biserni S., Ferrari A., Lawrence S.M., Llusa M., Khinast J.G., Accuracy of micro powder dosing via a vibratory sieve-chute system, Eur.

However, little information is available regarding the frequencies of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation during the post-pandemic period. We aimed to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among French university students. Methods: In this comparative study, 4463 students were recruited during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period (2013-2020) and 1768 students, during the post-COVID-19 pandemic period (2022-2023). Standardized frequencies of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were compared between the two time periods. Changes in the level of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation between the pre- and post-pandemic periods, were then analyzed using interrupted time series analysis. Results: Compared to participants from the pre-pandemic sample, participants from the post-pandemic sample had higher standardized rates of depressive symptoms (40.6 % vs 25.6 %) and suicidal ideation (29.3 % vs 21.1 %). Segmented logistic regression showed an about 50 % increased risk of depressive symptoms (aOR, 1.47; 95 % CI, 1.01–2.13) and a 100 % increased risk of suicidal ideation (aOR, 2.00; 95 % CI, 1.33–3.00) in the post-pandemic period. Before the pandemic, there was no significant time-trend for depressive symptoms (aOR, 1.002; 95 % CI, 0.999–1.006) and suicidal thoughts (0.999–1.006; aOR, 0.999; 95 % CI, 0.995–1.002). Limitations: Potential biases related to self-selection of participants in the study and information bias. History of depression and suicide attempt were self-reported. Conclusions: These findings reveal an alarming deterioration of students' mental health in the post-pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic era. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Suicidal ideation; University students","adult; Article; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; female; Frenchman; human; lockdown; major clinical study; male; mental health; pandemic; risk assessment; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt; university student; young adult","","","","","","","Aguayo-Estremera R., Canadas G.R., Ortega-Campos E., Pradas-Hernandez L., Martos-Cabrera B., Velando-Soriano A., de la Fuente-Solana E.I., Levels of burnout and engagement after COVID-19 among psychology and nursing students in Spain: a cohort study, Int.

These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated it with several open-source libraries and applied this composite pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australia's 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. The pipeline's advantages include markedly increased speed, an expressive application programming interface, the transparency of open-source development, easy access to a broad range of calibration and optimisation tools and consideration of the full workflow from input manipulation through to algorithmic generation of the publication materials. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, with this approach selected as the model configuration for further epidemiological inference. Under our assumption of widespread immunity against severe outcomes from recent vaccination, incorporating an additional effect of the main vaccination programs rolled out during 2022 on transmission did not further improve model fit. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30–60% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months on average. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online code notebooks and plots. We demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a flexible domain-specific syntax library with state-of-the-art packages in high performance computing, calibration, optimisation and visualisation to create an end-to-end pipeline for infectious disease modelling. We used the resulting platform to demonstrate key epidemiological characteristics of the transition from the emergency to the endemic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2024 The Authors","Computational simulation; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Software design","algorithm; Article; Bayesian network; computer model; coronavirus disease 2019; data science; disease risk assessment; health program; heterologous immunity; immunity; infection fatality rate; mathematical computing; outcome assessment; SARS-CoV-2 Omicron; software design; vaccination","","","","","World Health Organization, WHO; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DE230100730); Medical Research Future Fund, (2022, RRDHI000027)","James Trauer is supported by a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council (DE230100730).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of internet-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for symptoms of depression in randomized controlled trial. Methods: Following recruitment via advertisement a total of 113 participants with mild to moderate symptoms of depression were included and randomized to either a ten-week internet-based IPT with weekly therapist guidance or a waitlist control condition. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression measured weekly with the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and at pre- and post-treatment assessment with the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Secondary outcomes were self-rated quality of life and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. We also measured therapeutic alliance and treatment credibility. Outcomes were evaluated with a latent growth curve model (for MADRS-S) and robust linear regression models (for the other measures). The trial was conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring of 2021. Results: Significant differences favoring the treatment group were found on three of the four outcomes: BDI-II, quality of life ratings, and ratings of generalized anxiety. Between-group effect sizes for these outcomes were moderate (BDI-II, quality of life) or small (generalized anxiety). The latent growth curve model did not indicate a significant difference on the weekly MADRS-S ratings. Exploratory analyses did not show an association between therapeutic alliance, treatment credibility and outcome. Limitations: Missing data at post-treatment was high in the treatment group (37 %), though the missingness was not significantly related to observed ratings at pre-treatment or estimated trajectories during the treatment. Few participants completed all modules. The Covid-19 pandemic situation may have affected both effects and dropout rates. Conclusions: Internet-based IPT can lead to significant improvements, though the reductions in symptoms of depression were not consistent across the two measures used. Completion rates and dropout patterns suggest a need for improved acceptability. Trial registration: The trial was preregistered at Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04721678).

From business to healthcare, the revolutions of predictive analytics studies are constantly evolving to help decision makers identify the problem and make a wise decision. While a bigger impact has been reported on the development of predictive models in business studies, there has been very little effort that investigates the deployment of predictive models by using machine learning approaches specifically involving SMEs. Small business entrepreneurs (SMEs) are among the entities most affected because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this study aims to develop a model that could predict the motivation score of GKP recipients based on three factors: satisfaction, perceived value, and perceived expectation. Four different regression models, namely Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and SVR, were developed and evaluated as the best model by using Rapid Miner machine learning software tools. The GKIPP grant dataset has been used as a case study for estimating the motive of the GKP grant to evaluate the outcomes of various regression models. The findings indicate that linear and SVR models have produced highly accurate predictions about the motivation of GKP recipients. They have also produced a high proportion of R-square scores across all regression models, which is highly encouraging. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

To achieve this, a quantitative research design was used, and a total of 500 students (101 boys and 399 girls) in Indonesia were selected as respondents using proportional random sampling techniques. Data collection was carried out using a learning motivation scale questionnaire. The results showed that students had a high level of motivation, with an average score of 50.8. The desire to work can be seen from hopes and dreams, as well as a conducive environment. It is known that external factors such as encouragement from others and involvement in activities have a greater influence with significance scores of 0.801 and 0.766 respectively. Meanwhile, appreciation and hopes or aspirations each received a score of 0.709 and 0.704. This implies that encouragement and activity can be integrated into the student's self. The research also shows that gender does not have a significant effect on the desire to learn. However, providing appropriate encouragement and rewards will increase students' willingness to learn, which can be maintained by educational institutions and parents and instill a desire for personal progress and development. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

The outbreak of the disease has affected the world in a negative manner. The development and on-going vaccination efforts has reduced the mortality rate in people with existing comorbidities and lowered virus transmission rate. However, there are still the needs for prescribed medicines that can be consumed by COVID-19 infected persons. Momordica charantia L. has been used in traditional medicines to treat various diseases including anti-diabetic and cancer. Pharmacological studies on Momordica charantia L. revealed that the plant stored many useful phytoconstituents that might be exploited for producing drug compounds to treat COVID-19. Nowadays, computational-aided drug methods are widely used in drug discovery process as it requires minimal compound design and improve the development pipeline. In this study, molecular docking of five phytochemicals from Momordica charantia L. were carried out against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The results obtained revealed that some of the phytochemicals showed a better dock score compared to the drug molnupiravir. Based on the dock score and the medicinal properties of each compound, it is suggested that these compounds can be further studied for potential drugs against COVID-19. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Teachers should be the key to solving problems. This research aims to measure how much influence the competence of professional elementary school teachers has on student engagement in Indonesia. This research uses a quantitative approach with a correlational design and survey method. Data collection was carried out through teacher professional competency and student involvement questionnaires, with data sources coming from elementary school teachers and students in the western, eastern, and central regions of Indonesia. Samples were taken using the cluster random sampling technique. Quantitative data analysis was used with descriptive statistical stages, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and comparative analysis. The results of the hypothesis test also show that professional competence in the aspect of understanding content and understanding the curriculum has a significant influence on student engagement, while in the aspect of understanding student character, it does not have a significant influence. These results make an important contribution to teachers' ongoing professional development. Aspects of content development and curriculum development are recommended as priorities for self-development. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Grounded on the paradigm that creativity is a tangible parameter, this study aims to explore students’ creative thinking skill via a reading-based creativity test. The test was developed by considering the creativity indicators defined by Paul Torrance, i.e., fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration. In this creativity test, the reading and the questions were designed to make students integrate their science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) knowledge. Based on the empirical validation, the creativity test had a reliability of 0.897, indicating that the test was reliable to measure students’ creativity. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the test was conducted online to 108 junior high school students in East Java, Indonesia. In general, the students achieved the highest level of creativity in terms of originality that gained average score of 3.63 (with scale 4.00). Meanwhile, they underperformed on the aspects of elaboration having average score of 2.40. There were 93 and 79 students who responded very well on the originality and fluency aspects, respectively. In contrast, respectively over 30% and 50% of students showed a lack of creativity on the aspect of flexibility and elaboration. These creativity assessment data are beneficial for educational stakeholders especially to increase the quality of teaching and learning related to STEAM education. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Feelings of disconnection and alienation interfere with learning and affect individual well-being. Although many students have physically returned to classrooms, it remains clear that online education, which predates the pandemic and expanded massively in 2020, is here to stay. This article attempts to answer the question, “how can education be ‘rooted’ in place when place itself is increasingly ephemeral, non-existent, or untethered to a geolocation?” This call to (teaching) action presents an argument for using place-based pedagogy adapted for the digital context to promote student connectedness, well-being, and engagement with curricular materials and describes strategies to incorporate place-based pedagogy-inspired materials and assignments in online classes across the curriculum. The practices described in this article can foster a place-based educational approach that supports learners’ connections to place and growth as citizens and scholars. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

The main protease (Mpro) is critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication and acts as an effective target for drug development. To date, many flavonoid compounds have been reported to exhibit inhibition of Mpro, and flavonoid structures are informative for the development of new inhibitors. In the present study, we first evaluated the ability of 35 flavonoid compounds to bind Mpro and found that the hydrophobic interaction generated between the benzene ring and the residues may be the main source of binding force. The in vitro inhibitory activity of these compounds was tested by the FRET method, and most of them showed significant inhibition of Mpro. Preliminary analysis revealed that the presence of the glycosidic group was detrimental to the activity of the compounds, in addition the position of the hydroxyl substituent had an effect on the activity of the compounds. Reliable and predictive CoMFA (q2 = 0.541, r2 = 0.998, SEE = 0.039) and CoMISA (q2 = 0.554, r2 = 0.999, SEE = 0.034) models were developed, and the compounds were analyzed by 3D-QSAR with modeled steric, electrostatic, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobic fields. A series of compounds were synthesized and characterized, which showed similar experimental and predicted activities, with the activity of 15d (IC50 = 0.74 ± 0.04 uM) exceeding that of the template molecule 15 (0.98 ± 0.13 uM). Subsequently, molecular docking revealed the binding mode of 15d to Mpro and verified the predictions of steric, hydrogen bond donor, and hydrophobic field. In conclusion, these findings provide ideas for subsequent structural studies of flavonoids that could be used in the development of flavonoid-type SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. © 2024","3D-QSAR; COVID-19; Flavonoid; SARS-CoV-2 main protease","Biomineralization; COVID-19; Molecular docking; SARS; Structural analysis; Surface scattering; 3D-QSAR; Flavonoid; Flavonoids compounds; Hydrogen bond donors; Hydrophobics; In-vitro; Molecular docking; Protease inhibitor; SARS-CoV-2 main protease; Sterics; Hydrogen bonds","","","","","","","Wu F., Zhao S., Yu B., Et al., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China, Nature, 579, pp. 265-269, (2020); Stein S.R., Ramelli S.C., Grazioli A., Et al., SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistence in the human body and brain at autopsy, Nature, 612, pp. 758-763, (2022); Lewnard J.A., Vennis H., Et al., Association of SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/BA.5 Omicron lineages with immune escape and clinical outcome, Nat.

The world lacked the means and methods for early detection of this virus. Several traditional methods were used for detecting the virus, such as thermometers, remote thermal detection guns, and other conventional methods. Most of these systems monopolized making profits or selling their camera products, with prices for these cameras equipped with temperature detection systems exceeding three thousand dollars. An unsupervised model for real-time detection of thermal face skin temperature is proposed. Despite the scarcity and limited availability of thermal video data, we found and used a database created at Nazarbayev University in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, which contains clips of thermal video and RGB video. The two different videos were calibrated, and the unity was measured by two metrics: SSIM and correlation. Four methods of registration were used to achieve perfect congruence, and congruence was also measured through the two previous metrics. The K-means method was then used to extract clusters, and functions for post-processing were built. The thermal face skin was extracted by multiplying the binary face mask with the thermal face, and the temperature of the face was calculated by taking the average values of the thermal face skin pixels and converting them from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Satisfactory results were obtained, with some temperatures detected within the normal range, others below the normal range, and others higher than this rate. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

Among the employed acoustic features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are widely used for automatic analysis, with MFCC extraction commonly relying on default parameters. However, no comprehensive study has systematically investigated the impact of MFCC extraction parameters on respiratory disease diagnosis. In this study, we address this gap by examining the effects of key parameters, namely the number of coefficients, frame length, and hop length between frames, on respiratory condition examination. Our investigation uses four datasets: the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, the Saarbrücken Voice Disorders (SVD) database, and a TACTICAS dataset. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier, given its widespread adoption and efficacy. Our findings indicate that the accuracy of MFCC decreases as hop length increases, and the optimal number of coefficients is observed to be approximately 30. The performance of MFCC varies with frame length across the datasets: for the COVID-19 datasets (Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database and Coswara dataset), performance declines with longer frame lengths, while for the SVD dataset, performance improves with increasing frame length (from 50 ms to 500 ms). Furthermore, we investigate the optimized combination of these parameters and observe substantial enhancements in accuracy. Compared to the worst combination, the SVM model achieves an accuracy of 81.1%, 80.6%, and 71.7%, with improvements of 19.6%, 16.10%, and 14.90% for the Cambridge COVID-19 Sound database, the Coswara dataset, and the SVD dataset respectively. To validate the generalization of these findings, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model as a validation model. Remarkably, the LSTM model also demonstrates improved accuracy of 14.12%, 10.10%, and 6.68% across the datasets when utilizing the optimal combination of parameters. The optimal parameters are validated using an external voice pathology dataset (TACTICAS dataset). The results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the optimized parameters across various pathologies, machine-learning models, and languages. © 2024 The Author(s)","Acoustic biomarkers; MFCC extraction parameters; Optimized parameters; Respiratory disease","COVID-19; Pulmonary diseases; Acoustic biomarker; Cambridge; Cepstral coefficient extractions; Extraction parameters; Frame length; Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient; Mel frequency cepstral coefficient extraction parameter; Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients; Optimized parameter; Sound database; Lung cancer","","","","","Lung Foundation Netherlands, LFN; University of Cambridge; Indian Institute of Science, IISc; Universität des Saarlandes; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (91716421, KICH1.GZ03.21.023, 7.3.22.013); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","Funding text 1: The work was supported by NWO Aspasia grant (no: 91716421), DACIL project (KICH1.GZ03.21.023), and the SPEAK-study (7.3.22.013) sponsored by the Lung Foundation Netherlands.

Methods: The Japanese government declared a state of emergency in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 309 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis between April 2017 and December 2022. Results: Patients were categorized into a pregroup (n = 134) and a postgroup (n = 175), depending on whether they were diagnosed before or after the state of emergency declaration. The total number of ERCP cases and the number of ERCP cases with endoscopic stone removals increased after the state of emergency declaration. Compared with the pregroup, the numbers of patients with performance status of 0–1 and surgically altered anatomy increased, whereas the numbers of patients taking oral antiplatelets or anticoagulants and those with cerebrovascular disease decreased in the postgroup. The number of single-stage endoscopic stone removals increased and hospital stays were significantly shorter in the postgroup. No differences in adverse event rates were detected between the two groups. Conclusions: Although our hospital provides tertiary care, the number of patients with cholangitis in good general condition and no underlying disease increased after the state of emergency declaration. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increase in the number of single-stage endoscopic treatments and shortened hospital stays for patients with acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis. No safety issues with ERCP were detected, even during the pandemic. © 2024 The Authors.

The closing price of each stock is used as the basis for calculating the cross-correlation between the companies' returns. Minimum spanning trees are employed to analyse the relationships and visualize the correlation changes for each period. Additionally, degree centrality is utilized to analyse the network's structure further. This study covers the period from 2020 to 2021 and involves 39 companies within the technology sector. The findings reveal significant fluctuations in the companies' correlations each year. Moreover, the most influential companies vary according to the period, demonstrating position changes. The fact that Inari Amertron (INAR), Revenue Group (REVE), and My EG Services (MYEG) consistently become leading players in different years shows how strong and influential they are in the technology sector. This suggests that these companies have the ability to shape market trends and possibly even control the direction of the industry. The results provide valuable insights for investors and policymakers, aiding in visualizing company relationships and facilitating strategic portfolio optimization. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

We firstly study the existence and uniqueness of the globally positive solution to the stochastic SIRI model with positive initial value. Then we obtain sufficient conditions for the extinction of the disease in the stochastic epidemic model, and find that the large noise can make the disease die out exponentially. Meanwhile, we obtain that the solution to the stochastic model has a unique stationary distribution when R0s˜ is greater than one. Our results show that the intensity of white noise can affect the dynamical behaviors of the model. Finally, we use numerical simulation to illustrate theoretical results, and apply both the stochastic and deterministic models to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic in Serbia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Generalized nonlinear incidence; SIRI model; Stationary distribution","","","","","","","","Berrhazi B., El Fatini M., Caraballo Garrido T., Et al., A stochastic SIRI epidemic model with Lévy noise, Discrete Contin.

The days of traditional antibiotics are over since their overuse has led to worldwide health and environmental issues. Thus, there is a need for novel antimicrobial proteins/peptides with improved properties over existing ones. The goal of microbiology research over the past ten years has been to identify, create, and market antimicrobials from benign microorganisms that are just as effective. The bioactive peptides or proteins, synthesized by probiotics and other beneficial microorganisms, are also referred to as postbiotics. The application of the recently created postbiotics is unrestricted in the food sector. Nisin and pediocin are two postbiotics that are widely used in the worldwide food sector. If successful, they could also be the best candidates to be therapeutic proteins that take the place of traditional antibiotics. Scope and approach: To gain a comprehensive understanding of today's postbiotic landscape, it's crucial to grasp the importance of bacteriocin and its diverse applications across various sectors such as food, heterologous expression, bioprocessing, and as a substitute for antibiotics. Key findings and conclusions: Peptides with antibacterial properties that are authorized for use in the food industry are known as bacteriocins. They are utilized in agriculture, the food industry, and other fields. Due to new restrictions, stronger antiviral treatments are among the novel antimicrobial drugs being researched. The potential application of bacteriocins in COVID-19 therapy is under investigation. Additionally, other alternatives such as plant-based chemicals, animal venoms, and bacteriophage therapy have also contributed to the development of antibiotic substitutes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Antimicrobials; Lactococcus; Nisin; Pediocin; Postbiotics; Probiotics","","","","","","Life Sciences Research Board, LSRB; CSIR-CFTRI; Ministry of Food Processing Industries, MOFPI; Defence Research and Development Organisation, DRDO","This work was supported by the fund of LSRB (The Life Sciences Research Board (LSRB) of Defence Research & Development Organisation) and MOFPI (Ministry of Food Processing Industries).

Understanding the factors influencing purchase intention in an online shopping context is crucial for businesses to optimize the customer experience and increase sales. Besides, the impact of the changes that will be made by the online business based on the study result will hopefully make it easier for users to make purchasing decisions and enjoy using online services without feeling insecure about various scam activities. Therefore, this study aims to identify the factors that drive consumers' purchase intentions for online shopping in Malaysia. Using a voluntary sampling technique in the survey approach, a total of 158 respondents' data in Malaysia were selected and analyzed using multiple linear regression. Four factors were chosen in relation to purchase intention which are price, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social media. The output revealed that price, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social media have a positive significant effect on consumers’ purchase intention. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Changes over time can affect the demographic characteristics of the blood donor population. Voluntary donors tend to be safer than replacement donors in terms of TTIs transmission risks. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of voluntary and replacement blood donors in Dr. Sardjito Hospital Blood Center. This retrospective study analyzed the data of whole blood donors from January 2017 to May 2020. The number of donations was calculated as cumulative number based on the donor data bases. Data were presented as median (minimum-maximum) and proportion. Analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. There were 54,152 blood donors during the study period, consisted of 47,525 (87.8%) voluntary donors and 6,627 (12.2%) replacement donors. Most of the donors were male, with higher proportion in replacement donors (p <0.001). Voluntary donors tended to be younger than replacement ones [30(17-77) years and 35(17-70) years, respectively] (p <0.001). Voluntary donors gave blood more frequently (p <0.001). The proportion of donation number in two groups showed significantly different (p <0.001). The most donated blood types were O, D positive. There was an increasing trend in the monthly number of bloods donated from 2017 to 2019, but a decreasing trend in 2020. The decrease of blood donation during 2020, may be related to COVID-19 pandemic. © 2025 by SPC.","Blood donors; donor demography; replacement donors; voluntary donors","","","","","","","","Ghaffari Y.D., Ghorbanian N., Modern blood banking & transfusion practices, Eurasian Journal of Science and Technology, 3, (2018);

Most studies used large-scale, aggregated data, with limited adjustment for individual factors, most of them focused on viral spread than severe outcomes. Moreover, evidence simultaneously evaluating variables belonging to different exposure domains is scarce, and none analysing their collective impact on an individual level. Methods: Our population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the comprehensive role played by exposure variables belonging to four different domains, environmental, climatic, socio-economic, and non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), on individual COVID-19-related risk of hospitalization and death, analysing data from all patients (no. 68472) tested positive to a SARS-CoV-2 swab in Modena Province (Northern Italy) between February 2020 and August 2021. Using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, investigating dose-response relationships through restricted cubic spline modelling for hazard ratios. Results: Several significant associations emerged: long-term exposure to air pollutants (NO2, PM10, PM2.5) was linked to hospitalization risk in a complex way and showed an increased risk for death; while humidity was inversely associated; temperature showed a U-shaped risk; wind speed showed a linear association with both outcomes. Precipitation increased hospitalization risk but decreased mortality. Socio-economic and NPI indices showed clear linear associations, respectively negative and positive, with both outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings offer insights for evidence-based policy decisions, improving precision healthcare practices, and safeguarding public health in future pandemics. Refinement of pandemic response plans by healthcare authorities could benefit significantly. © 2024 The Author(s)","Containment and health index; COVID-19 outcomes; Deprivation index; Environmental and climate factors; Italy; Restrictive measures","","","","","","","","Antolini G., Auteri L., Pavan V., Tomei F., Tomozeiu R., Marletto V., A daily high-resolution gridded climatic data set for Emilia-Romagna, Italy, during 1961-2010: emilia-romagna daily gridded climatic data set, Int.

Design: Based on the K-means clustering algorithm, a comprehensive analysis of survey data identifies distinct consumer clusters based on their adaptive capacities, resilience, and shopping preferences. The study encompasses a broad demographic spectrum, examining various aspects such as age, urban or rural residence, education, household size, and income. Findings: The findings identify several clusters of consumers showing specific behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and their subsequent shopping behaviours, unveiling distinct profiles of adaptation, resilience, and shopping preferences. The K-means clustering algorithm allows the identification of four distinct consumer clusters. Implications: The results have significant implications for understanding consumer behaviour, tailoring marketing strategies, and shaping the future of retail under the New Normal. Each cluster's characteristics provide valuable insights for businesses to align strategies with evolving consumer needs, considering both demographic factors and shopping preferences. Originality: The research contributes to the understanding of consumer behaviour during times of crisis, providing relevant insights from a theoretical perspective based on the K-means clustering algorithm. © 2024 The Authors","Adaptation; Clusters; Consumer behavior; COVID-19; Pandemic impact; Resilience; Shopping preferences","","","","","","","","Agrawal D.K., Gupta S., A new theoretical framework of shopping motives and channel preference behaviour in the digital era, Int.

The gas/particle partitioning coefficients (Kp) of the PAHs were calculated from the supercooled liquid vapour pressure and octanol-air partitioning coefficient based on the relationships obtained in previous traffic pollution-related studies. Gaseous PAHs were estimated by Kp and the concentrations of PM and particulate PAHs. The concentrations of total PAHs were 32.5, 320.1 and 5646.2 pg/m3 in the PM>2.5, PM2.5 and gas phases, respectively. Significant seasonal trends in PAHs were observed (particle phase: lowest in summer, gas phase: lowest in spring, particle and gas phase: lowest in spring). Compared to 2019, the total PAH concentrations (in particles) decreased in 2020, especially in spring and summer, which might be due to reduced traffic trips during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) calculated from the toxic equivalent concentrations relative to benzo[a]pyrene (BaPeq) was lower than the acceptable limit issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency, indicating a low cancer risk in long-term exposure to current PAH levels. It is notable that gaseous PAHs considerably contributed to BaPeq and ILCR (over 50%), which highlighted the significance of gaseous PAH monitoring for public health protection. This low-cost estimation method for gaseous PAHs can be expected to reliably and conveniently obtain PAH concentrations as a surrogate for traditional sampling in the future work. © 2023","COVID-19; Exposure-response relationship; Gas-particle partitioning; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Traffic","Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Japan; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions; Chubu; Honshu; Ishikawa; Japan; Kanazawa; Aromatization; Cost estimating; Environmental Protection Agency; Mineral oils; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Cancer risk; Exposure-response relationships; Gas-phases; Gas/particle partitioning; Particle phase; Partitioning coefficients; PM 2.5; Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Traffic; atmospheric pollution; cancer; COVID-19; estimation method; health risk; PAH; partition coefficient; traffic management; vapor pressure; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Japan; particulate matter; procedures; season; COVID-19","","Air Pollutants, ; Particulate Matter, ; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, ; Vehicle Emissions, ","","","Cooperative Research Programs of Institute of Nature and Environmental Technology, (22002, 22007, 22013); Environmental Policy Department of the Kanazawa City Environment Division; Kanazawa University, KU; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (JPJSBP120219914); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Japan (No. JPJSBP120219914); the CHOZEN Project of Kanazawa University, Japan (2019); and the Cooperative Research Programs of Institute of Nature and Environmental Technology, Kanazawa University, Japan (22002, 22013, 22007).

In this concern, Favipiravir (FAV) has attracted considerable attention as an effective antiviral drug against this disease. In this study, the favipiravir's derivative (3‑hydroxy-6-methoxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) was synthetized, in presence of iron (III), and fully characterized through various analytical techniques including single-XRay, IR, UV and 1H/13C NMR. The refinement show the exclusive existence of enol form in the solid state. In solution, UV and NMR data were used to highlight the tautomeric equilibrium of this molecule. Additionally, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were achieved to estimate the chemical parameters, electronic affinity and molecular electrostatic potential of the compound. Mulliken atomic charges as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. Finally, the two tautomer forms of synthetized derivative were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) and spike receptor-binding domain (PDB: 7BZ5) to evaluate their binding affinity. The docking simulation studies was predicted that the two forms had high binding affinity the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. This affinity was attributed to the presence of several hydrogen bonds for both tautomer along with five different hydrophobic interactions with the enol form. These results conduct to conclude that the synthetized product could be an interest potential drug for that type of diseases. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Favipiravir derivative; Lewis acid; Molecular docking; Single XRay","Hydrogen bonds; Anti-viral drugs; Binding affinities; Carboxamides; Density-functional-theory; Docking studies; Favipiravir derivative; Lewis Acid; Methoxypyrazines; Molecular docking; Single xray; Molecular docking","","","","","","","Estimating excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic analysis of COVID-19-related mortality, 2020-21, Lancet, 399, pp. 1513-1536, (2022); Qomara W.F., Primanissa D.N., Amalia S.H., Purwadi F.V., Zakiyah N., Effectiveness of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment: a systematic review, Int.

This paper offers a comprehensive evaluation of different adsorbents, including 13X, LiLSX, 5A, CaX, Ag-ETS-10, and AgLiLSX, utilized in MOCs. Process modeling and multi-objective optimization are conducted to assess the effectiveness of these adsorbents using the Skarstrøm cycle, employing pressure swing adsorption (PSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), and pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) processes. The optimization result indicates that LiLSX is the top choice, providing medical-grade oxygen at a total product flow rate exceeding 15 SLPM. Additionally, 13X and CaX are identified as economical alternatives, particularly suitable for employment in the PSA and VSA processes, respectively. This study highlights the significance of establishing a connection between the Medical and Chemical Engineering communities through the direct incorporation of medical performance indicators, such as the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2), into the optimization process. The findings serve as a guide for selecting an appropriate design based on the patient's requirements and demonstrate LiLSX's capability to meet a diverse range of treatments, achieving FIO2 values up to 0.75. Furthermore, we explore the flexibility of MOC designs in meeting the demands of multiple patients simultaneously and propose energy-efficient design options based on patient needs. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing MOCs, ensuring effective and reliable oxygen therapy for patients, while also addressing challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and potential global lithium scarcity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Material screening; Medical oxygen concentrator; Pressure swing adsorption; Process optimization","Adsorption; Diagnosis; Disease control; Energy efficiency; Indicators (chemical); Multiobjective optimization; Patient treatment; Screening; Adsorption process; Comprehensive evaluation; ETS-10; Material screening; Medical oxygen concentrators; Modeling objectives; Pressure swing adsorption; Process optimisation; Process-models; Vacuum swing adsorptions; Oxygen","","","","","University of Alberta, U of A; Amirkabir University of Technology, AUT, (ISI-DCE-DOD-Cloud-900808-1700); Amirkabir University of Technology, AUT","Funding text 1: S.A.H.H. acknowledges the support of the Simorgh Supercomputer - Amirkabir University of Technology under Contract No ISI-DCE-DOD-Cloud-900808-1700.

We have witnessed worldwide disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic because of infectious viruses, and these incidents often unfold in various phases and waves. During this pandemic, so many deaths have occurred worldwide that they cannot even be counted accurately. The biggest issue that comes to the forefront is that health workers going to treat patients suffering from COVID-19 also may get infected. Many health workers have lost their lives to COVID-19 and are still losing their lives. The situation can worsen further by coinciding with other natural disasters like cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis. In these situations, an intelligent automated model is needed to provide contactless medical services such as ambulance facilities and primary health tests. In this paper, we explore these types of services safely with the help of an intelligent automated transportation model using a vehicular delay-tolerant network. To solve the scenario, we propose an intelligent transportation system for automated medical services to prevent healthcare workers from becoming infected during testing and collecting health data by collaborating with a delay-tolerant network of vehicles in intelligent transport systems. The proposed model automatically categorizes and filters infected patients, providing medical facilities based on their illnesses. Our mathematical evaluation and simulation results affirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model, highlighting its strength compared to existing state-of-the-art protocols. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Automation; Intelligent transportation system (ITS); Machine learning; Opportunistic network; Routing protocol; Smart medical service; Vehicular delay tolerant networks (VDTN)","Delay tolerant networks; Patient treatment; Infectious virus; Intelligent transportation system; Intelligent transportation systems; Machine-learning; Medical services; Opportunistic network; Routing-protocol; Smart medical service; Vehicular delay tolerant network; Vehicular delay-tolerant networks; COVID-19","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","Ranesh Naha is currently a research fellow at the University of Adelaide.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, UCC applications, such as Microsoft Team, Zoom Meeting, and Google Meet played major roles to support the teaching and learning process. However, the acceptance of UCC applications and their impacts on the future of teaching and learning process, especially for university students in rural areas, are concerned. Based on this, the current study aims to examine the factors that influence the acceptance of UCC applications at the University in Sumbawa Island, Indonesia using adapted theories of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT). In light, survey questionnaire was distributed online to 210 undergraduate students at the University in Sumbawa Island, Indonesia, to test seven factors, Facilitating Condition (FC), Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Motivation (MO), Collaboration (CO), and Behavioural Intention (BI) which were analysed using SPSS software. The findings reveal that PE, EE, SI, FC, MO, CO, and BI are significant factors that influence the acceptance of UCC applications. This finding will be a sound reference to improve the use of UCC applications for teaching and learning as well as help universities strategies their future teaching and learning system. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Some experts recommend 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for all patients, while others suggest 7–9 mL/kg PBW for those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O. We investigated whether a tidal volume ≥ 7 ml/kg PBW may be safe in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with compliance >50 mL/cmH2O. Materials and methods: This secondary analysis of a multicenter study compares the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality among 600 patients ventilated with <7 or ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW. Compliance was categorized as <40, 40–50, or > 50 mL/cmH2O. Results: 346 patients were ventilated with <7 (6.2 ± 0.5) mL/kg PBW and 254 with ≥7 (7.9 ± 0.9) mL/kg PBW. ICU mortality was 33 % and 29 % in the two groups (p = 0.272). At multivariable regression analysis, tidal volume ≥ 7 mL/kg PBW was associated with lower ICU mortality in the overall population (odds ratio: 0.62 [95 %-confidence interval: 0.40–0.95]) and in each compliance category. Conclusions: A tidal volume ≥ 7 (up to 9) mL/kg PBW was associated with lower ICU mortality in these COVID-19 patients, including those with compliance <40 mL/cmH2O. This finding should be interpreted cautiously due to the retrospective study design.

We analyze the model for stability, and the results demonstrate the system's stable behavior under specific conditions, suggesting the possibility of effective control. The model is subjected to sensitivity analysis, revealing the most influential parameters affecting the infestation's dynamics. These parameters are identified as key targets for intervention. The optimal control strategy is derived using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, minimizing the cost of intervention while effectively controlling the infestation. The results demonstrate the importance of early intervention and sustained control efforts. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of scabies infestation dynamics, highlighting the critical factors influencing its spread and the most effective control strategies. The findings inform public health policy and guide resource allocation to combat scabies infestations effectively. The major contributions include improved understanding of scabies transmission dynamics, identification of critical parameters, development of evidence-based control strategies, evaluation of resource allocation effectiveness, and assessing intervention impact. It may also contribute to public health policy, resource allocation, disease surveillance, and intervention strategies.

Although mortality and morbidity effects have been disproportionately felt among older generations, there is growing recognition that adolescents have also faced multidimensional consequences, fueled by closure of schools and recreational spaces, and widespread disruption to services. While much has been written about the educational and health effects of the pandemic on adolescents, less attention has been given to other aspects of their wellbeing. This narrative review therefore summarizes the current evidence on the effects of the pandemic on adolescent wellbeing. We draw on the United Nations (UN) H6 + Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Well-being's conceptualization of adolescent wellbeing (Ross et al., 2020), focusing on three domains: connectedness, positive values and contribution to society; safety and a supportive environment; and agency and resilience. Drawing on both peer-reviewed and grey literature from high-, middle- and low-income contexts, we focused our search on adolescents (aged 10–19) and Covid-19 pandemic-related effects on wellbeing in these three domains. We also highlight findings related to three groups of adolescents who have often been overlooked in the literature on the impact of the pandemic: adolescent refugees, married adolescents, and adolescents with disabilities. We searched using Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus, as well as working paper series at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and the World Bank, to identify published and grey literature across the three domains of interest. We restricted the search to articles that presented new, original data, included adolescents (aged 10–19), and were published in English, between January 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022. We expanded the search to make use of the bibliographies uncovered through this review to check for other citations that might meet the search criteria. The search yielded 193 articles on adolescent wellbeing in the three domains of interest during the Covid–19 pandemic. Adolescents in high-income countries (HICs) were overrepresented compared to those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (126 vs. 60 articles). Furthermore, more articles focused on social connectedness (117 studies) than on adolescent wellbeing in terms of agency and resilience (73 studies) and safety and a supportive environment (61 studies). Nearly three years after the Covid-19 pandemic's onset, the literature on adolescent wellbeing highlights the multiple and intersecting challenges that adolescents faced, especially those living in LMICs. Service disruptions (notably school closures) combined with financial stress, heightened vulnerability to age- and gender-based violence, and social isolation placed unprecedented pressures on young people, taking a toll on their physical and mental health. Evidence that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities – with the most vulnerable adolescents (such as refugees, adolescents with disabilities and married girls) seemingly worst affected – is particularly salient for policy makers. While many adolescents are finding ways to cope (by relying on family and teacher support, connecting with peers through online networks or volunteering), understanding how to promote adolescent resilience more effectively – particularly in LMIC contexts – will be essential to ensure a rapid post-Covid-19 recovery. © 2024","Adolescence; Agency; Covid-19; Resilience; Safety; Social-emotional development","","","","","","","","(2021); Alvis L.M., Douglas R.D., Shook N.J., Oosterhoff B., Associations between adolescents’ prosocial experiences and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, Current Psychology, (2022); Antoniou A.-S., Palivakou E., Polychroni F., Resilience in children and adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic, Developmental and Adolescent Health, 1, 4, pp. 34-41, (2021); Bai Y., Liu X., Zhang B., Fu M., Huang N., Hu Q., Guo J., Associations of youth mental health, parental psychological distress, and family relationships during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, BMC Psychiatry, 22, 1, (2022); Baird S., Alheiwidi S., Dutton R., Mitu K., Oakley E., Woldehanna T., Jones N., Social isolation and disrupted privacy, Girlhood Studies, 13, 3, pp. 98-115, (2020); Baird S., Murphy M., Seager J., Jones N., Malhotra A., Alheiwidi S., Emirie G., Rashid S., Sultan M., Intersecting disadvantages for married adolescents: Life after marriage pre- and post-COVID-19 in contexts of displacement, Journal of Adolescent Health, 70, 3S, pp. S86-S96, (2022); Banati P., Jones N., Youssef S., Intersecting vulnerabilities: The impacts of COVID-19 on the psycho-emotional lives of young people in low- and middle-income countries, European Journal of Development Research, 32, pp. 1613-1638, (2020); Barendse M.E.A., Flannery J., Cavanagh C., Aristizabal M., Becker S.P., Berger E., Breaux R., Campione-Barr N., Church J.A., Crone E.A., Dahl R.E., Dennis-Tiwary T.A., Dvorsky M.R., Dziura S.L., van de Groep S., Ho T.C., Killoren S.E., Langberg J.M., Larguinho T.L., Pfeifer J.H., Longitudinal change in adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, Journal of Research on Adolescence, (2022); Bellerose M., Diaw M., Pinchoff J., Kangwana B., Austrian K., Pre-pandemic influences on Kenyan girls’ transitions to adulthood during COVID-19, Girlhood Studies, 13, 3, pp. 113-150, (2020); Besser A., Flett G.L., Nepon T., Zeigler-Hill V., Personality, cognition, and adaptability to the COVID-19 pandemic: Associations with loneliness, distress, and positive and negative mood states, International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 20, 2, pp. 971-995, (2022); Biswas T., Scott J.G., Munir K., Renzaho A.M.N., Rawal L.B., Baxter J., Mamun A.A., Global variation in the prevalence of suicidal ideation, anxiety and their correlates among adolescents: A population based study of 82 countries, eClinicalMedicine, 24, (2020); Blackwell C.K., Mansolf M., Sherlock P., Ganiban J., Hofheimer J.A., Barone C.J., Wright R.J., Youth well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic, Pediatrics, 149, 4, (2022); Bourgault S., Peterman A., O'Donnell M.; Boursier V., Gioia F., Musetti A., Schimmenti A., COVID-19-related fears, stress and depression in adolescents: The role of loneliness and relational closeness to online friends, Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 1-23, (2022); Bravo-Sanzana M., Oriol X., Miranda R., Characterization of wellbeing and its relationship with exposure to violence in Mexican and Chilean early and late adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, Child Indicators Research, 1-26, (2022); Bulow A., Keijsers L., Boele S., van Roekel E., Denissen J.J.A., Parenting adolescents in times of a pandemic: Changes in relationship quality, autonomy support, and parental control?, Developmental Psychology, 57, 10, pp. 1582-1596, (2021); Canady V.A., CDC data finds sharp rise in suicide attempts among teen girls amid COVID-19, Mental Health Weekly, 31, 24, (2021); Cao C., Wang L., Fang R., Liu P., Bi Y., Luo S., Grace E., Olff M., Anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms among high school students in China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, Journal of Affective Disorders, 296, pp. 126-129, (2022); Cassinat J.R., Whiteman S.D., Serang S., Dotterer A.M., Mustillo S.A., Maggs J.L., Kelly B.C., Changes in family chaos and family relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a longitudinal study, Developmental Psychology, 57, 10, pp. 1597-1610, (2021); Chaabane S., Doraiswamy S., Chaabna K., Mamtani R., Cheema S., The impact of COVID-19 school closure on child and adolescent health: A rapid systematic review, Children, 8, 5, (2021); Chaharbaghi Z., Hosseini F.B., Baniasadi T., Moradi L., Dana A., Impact of physical activity on resilience among teenage girls during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mediation by self-esteem.

Firstly, we conduct a qualitative analysis of both within-host and between-host models. For the within-host model, we prove the existence and stability of equilibria, and Hopf bifurcation occurs from the infection equilibrium with immune response. This implies that, under specific immune states, the virus within an infected individual may persist, and its concentration may also oscillate periodically. For the between-host model, the disease-free equilibrium always exists and is locally asymptotically stable when the epidemiological basic reproduction number ℜ0<1. In addition, the model can have boundary equilibria of strain 1 or strain 2, which are locally asymptotically stable under specific conditions. However, the co-existence equilibrium does not exist. Secondly, to explore the infection and transmission mechanisms of two strain models and obtain reliable parameter values, we utilize statistical data to fit the immuno-epidemiological model. Simultaneously, we conduct an identifiability analysis of the immuno-epidemiological model to ensure the robustness of the fitted parameters. The results demonstrate the reliable estimation of parameter ranges for structurally unidentifiable parameters with minor measurement errors using the affine invariant ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (GWMCMC). Moreover, simulations illustrate that enhancing treatment of patients infected with BA.2 strains to inhibit the number of viruses released by infected cells can significantly reduce disease spread. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Between-host dynamics; Identifiability analysis; Immuno-epidemiology; Within-host dynamics","Asymptotically stable; Between-host dynamic; Epidemiological modeling; Host models; Identifiability analysis; Immuno-epidemiology; Modelling and analysis; Re-infection; Strain modeling; Within-host dynamic; Markov chains","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12071281); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (22JC1401401)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 12071281) and Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, China (No. 22JC1401401).

Healthcare systems had difficulty acquiring important supplies, such as face shields, which at that time were essential for healthcare staff. The need for this material increased with the spread of the pandemic. In most areas, warehouses did not have a sufficient stock of this product. This situation has occurred in the cities and provinces of Burgos (Spain). Volunteers (citizens and small companies) owning three-dimensional printers offered themselves to manufacture face shields. These volunteers are called “makers.” Similarly, different organizations (mainly Civil Protection) took charge of transport activities (delivery of material to the makers, collection of face shields, and delivery of the latter to hospitals and other entities). In this study, we were tasked with developing a system for planning and rationalizing these activities. The problems that were solved included a vehicle routing problem with different characteristics compared with other models in the literature. A previuous work described this problem, and the heuristic method used for the planning. However, it is necessary to develop tools that are as efficient as possible for similar situations. In this study, we propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and a method based on the metaheuristic strategies variable neighborhood search and greedy randomize adaptative search procedure on a multistart framework. Different tests with real instances used during the period in which these activities were conducted show that the new method improves the results obtained by the previous method as well as the commercial software. © 2023 The Authors.

Conventional techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection have limitations, as high cost, low specificity, and longer analysis time, among others. Biosensors emerge as a necessary alternative to overcome the difficulties of current diagnostics. This paper reports a sensor platform where silver-doped zinc oxide nanomaterial (Ag:ZnONp) was used onto carbon screen-printed electrode and ethidium bromide as indicator for development of a specific electrochemical genosensor for COVID-19. This genosensor demonstrated good linearity between the concentrations of 5.62 × 104–5.62 copies/mL and a detection limit of 5 copies/mL with gRNA in patient's samples, with a response time within 30 min. Molecular modeling and morphological analysis are in agreement with obtained electrochemical results. Additional techniques such as AFM, SEM, and EIS were conducted to characterize the morphological and electrochemical properties of the biosensor's surface.

Various forecasting models attempted to estimate the temporal course of the COVID-19 pandemic during this time period in order to determine effectiveness of the government action in facing COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were used in order to forecast the COVID-19 mortality rates data in Malaysia. The accuracy of the ARIMA models is then evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Absolute Error (RMSE). The forecasting model with the lowest error is picked as the best. In this study, ARIMA (1,1,3) outperformed the ARIMA (1,1,2) and ARIMA (1,1,4) models since it has the lowest MAE and RMSE values. However, as compared to ARIMA (1,1,4), the study found that ARIMA (1,1,3) model is not adequate in terms of model fitting due to the errors were not normally distributed. Hence, ARIMA (1,1,4) model was chosen to make prediction of COVID-19 mortality rates. Accordingly, the findings through this study can be used as a preliminary study to predict the COVID-19 mortality rates and other future pandemic cases to mitigate risk of increasing cases. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Various research results show that compared with Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's molnupiravir, Ensitrelvir is currently the most effective, safest and longest-lasting drug in the world! The synthesis of ensitrevir can be divided into four segments, and the docking of these four segments. Among them, the challenging segments are the triazole and indole segments due to the issue of methylation selectivity. In this study, DFT theory was primarily employed to investigate the activation energy of 1-methyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester and its positional isomers under different solvent conditions. Through experimental screening, selective methylation of 1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester was achieved. Subsequently, single crystals of the main product were cultivated, and calculations of electron density, nuclear magnetic resonance vibrations, etc., were performed for the three products to study the differences in the properties of various methylation products. Further structural confirmation of the three compounds was carried out using HMBC two-dimensional spectra. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Ensitrevir; Nsp5; Triazole, DFT","Activation energy; Alkylation; Esters; Isomers; Methylation; Single crystals; DFT theory; Energy calculation; Ensitrevir; Long lasting; Methyl esters; Nsp5; Positional isomers; Research results; Spectra's; Triazole, DFT; COVID-19","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81903474, 82073700, 22207077)","This work was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 81903474, 82073700, and 22207077).","Tyrrell D.A., Bynoe M.L., Cultivation of viruses from a high proportion of patients with colds, Lancet, 1, 7428, pp. 76-77, (1966); Kahn J.S., McIntosh K., History and recent advances in coronavirus discovery, Pediatr.

It has the capability of generating income, creating job opportunities and help people to understand the culture diversity of other countries. Therefore, tourism demand forecasting is really needed to help the practitioners involved as well as government in pricing setting, in assessing future requirements of capacity to fulfil the customers’ demand or in making wise decisions on whether to explore new market or not. This study focuses on tourism demand forecasting based on the number of tourist arrival using recurrent neural network (RNN), which is long-short term memory (LSTM) model. The data used in this study is historical data of number of tourist arrivals in Malaysia before the onset of Movement Control Order (MCO) starting from January 2000 to February 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The data set was divided into two subsets, training and testing data sets based on ratio 80:20. The objective of this study is to determine an accurate forecasting model especially in tourism industry in Malaysia. The forecast evaluation implemented to predict the error of each model are Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the analyses for this model was performed by using Python software. Based on the results obtained, the LSTM model was considered as one of the accurate prediction methods for tourism demand in Malaysia due to the least error produced. It is hoped that these results can help the government as well as practitioners in tourism industry to make a right judgement and formulate better tourism plans in order to minimize any consequences in the future. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

The underlying premise is that stock prices should discount future company cash flows, and the projection of these cash flows can be proxied by investors' ability to forecast macroeconomic conditions. We assess stock market performance from January 2020 to February 2022 in 16 countries, equally split between developed and emerging markets. While results varied, the study suggests that stock markets generally predicted economic activity during Covid-19. The modeling test indicated that stock markets significantly predicted economic activity in 11 out of 16 countries, particularly in developed markets. Furthermore, incorporating the stock market as a variable, improved economic forecasts in all 16 countries. Unlike other studies that mainly focused on the characteristics of share price movements, this research judges the rationality of stock markets against an external criterion. Ultimately, it suggests that EMH was mostly vindicated during the Covid-19 period. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19; Economic Tracker; Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH); OECD countries","","","","","","","","Aylward A., Glen J., Some international evidence on stock prices as leading indicators of economic activity, Appl.

COVID-19 is broadly recognized with effects on multiple systems in the body, and various factors related to society, medicine, and genetics/epigenetics may contribute to the intensity and results of the disease. Additionally, a SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate pathological activities and expedite the emergence of existing health issues into clinical problems. Forming easily accessible, distinctive, and permeable biomarkers is essential for categorizing patients, preventing the disease, predicting its course, and tailoring treatments for COVID-19 individually. One promising candidate for such biomarkers is microRNAs, which could serve various purposes in understanding diverse forms of COVID-19, including susceptibility, intensity, disease progression, outcomes, and potential therapeutic options. This review provides an overview of the most significant findings related to the involvement of microRNAs in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Furthermore, it explores the function of microRNAs in a broad span of effects that may arise from accompanying or underlying health status. It underscores the value of comprehending how diverse conditions, such as neurological disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity, interact with COVID-19. © 2024 The Authors","COVID-19; Diabetes; Heart disease; microRNA; Neurological disease; Obesity","biological marker; microRNA; aged; cardiovascular disease; complication; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; drug therapy; epigenetics; health status; heart disease; human; motor neuron disease; neurologic disease; nonhuman; obesity; pathogenesis; review","","","","","","","Zhou P., Yang X.-L., Wang X.-G., Hu B., Zhang L., Zhang W., Et al., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin, nature, 579, 7798, pp. 270-273, (2020); Zhang Q., Bastard P., Cobat A., Casanova J.-L., Human genetic and immunological determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia, Nature, 603, 7902, pp. 587-598, (2022); Giacomelli A., Ridolfo A.L., Pezzati L., Oreni L., Carrozzo G., Beltrami M., Et al., Mortality rates among COVID-19 patients hospitalised during the first three waves of the epidemic in Milan, Italy: a prospective observational study, PLoS One, 17, 4, (2022); Niemi M.E., Daly M.J., Ganna A., The human genetic epidemiology of COVID-19, Nat.

In this study, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole brain in 43 working-age adults (mean age: 44.79±10.80; range: 24–65 years) with a history of COVID-19 (731.17±312.41 days post-diagnosis), and also assessed their cognitive function (processing speed, attention, working memory, executive function, and recognition memory), mental health, and sleep quality. MRI data were processed using FSL to derive regional volumes for bilateral nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and total grey matter, white matter, and cerebral spinal fluid volume, and analysed in relation to persistent COVID-19 symptom load, mental health, and sleep quality. Higher persistent COVID-19 symptom load was significantly associated with smaller putamen volume, lower response accuracy on working memory, executive function, and recognition memory tasks, as well as a longer time to complete the executive function task, and poorer mental health and sleep quality. Smaller putamen fully mediated the relationship between persistent COVID-19 symptom load and lower executive function. Further research is required to confirm whether reduced putamen volume and its association with poor executive function persists in COVID-19 survivors in the long term. © 2024 The Authors","Brain fog; Executive function; Mediation; Mild cognitive problems; Putamen; SARS-CoV-2","2-Back task; adult; aged; amygdala; Article; attention; brain function; brain size; brain structure; cerebrospinal fluid; Choice Reaction Time task; cognition; coronavirus disease 2019; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; dorsal striatum; executive function; female; globus pallidus; gray matter; hippocampus; human; human experiment; male; mental health; nucleus accumbens; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; processing speed; putamen; sleep quality; T1 weighted imaging; task performance; thalamus; trail making test; white matter; working memory","","","3 Tesla Magnetom TIM Trio whole-body MRI scanner, Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany; Statistical Package for Social  Sciences  software for Windows version 28, IBM, United States","IBM, United States; Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany","","","Al-Qahtani A.A., Alhamlan F.S., Al-Qahtani A.A., Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins in infectious diseases: a comprehensive review, Trop.

Few studies have assessed stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19 after the pandemic. This paper investigated stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19 among Thai University students. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire to assess stress, depression, and public stigma resulting from COVID-19 among Thai university students between 15 and 30 August 2022. The questionnaire was developed by the Department of Mental Health, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. Public stigma was measured by the COVID-19 public stigma scale. The effects of public COVID-19 stigma on stress and depression were analyzed using multivariable multi-level logistic regression. A total of 2, 422 students completed the questionnaire. After multivariable analysis adjustment, students who experienced COVID-19 public stigma showed increased stress (AOR = 1.53; 95% CI [1.27–1.84]) and depression levels (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI [1.01–1.79]). Those who lived with high-risk COVID-19 individuals showed significant risk factors for stress, depression, and public stigma of COVID-19, while income presented the reverse effect. Those vaccinated with over two doses showed significantly reduced chances of depression. The COVID-19 public stigma plays a vital role in stress and depression levels among Thai university students. To mitigate stress and depression, an evaluation of public stigma is needed even after the pandemic. Further cohort studies are required to verify long-term results. © (2025), (Journal of Population and Social Studies).

Methods: The COVID-19 in Antibody Deficiency (COV-AD) study was a United Kingdom study that enrolled 525 participants between April 2021 and September 2022. Data on health care utilisation was extracted from a screening cohort of participants at one participating site (Birmingham, UK). Hospital attendance (i.e. all outpatient and inpatient care episodes, including hospital-based IVIG treatment) and emergency care attendance patterns were analysed. Geographical differences in travel times to hospitals and associated costs were considered for all participants at all recruiting sites. Results: Individuals with antibody deficiency had a median of 7 hospital attendances per year. A diagnosis of secondary antibody deficiency, and antibody deficiency severe enough to require treatment with immunoglobulin replacement were associated with an increased frequency of hospital attendance. 12.7% of the cohort attended the Emergency Department at least once in the preceding twelve months. Individuals with secondary antibody deficiency were at greater risk of requiring emergency care over the preceding one-year and five-year periods. Individuals receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin lived further from their local immunology centre and were more likely to engage with the COV-AD research study remotely, via dried blood spots sampling. Conclusion: This study highlights the utilisation of emergency and secondary care usage amongst patient with immunodeficiency and may inform service adaptation and development to better accommodate patient needs and circumstances. © The Author(s) 2024.","Healthcare Resource use; Inborn Errors of Immunity; Primary Immunodeficiency; Rare Disease; Secondary Immunodeficiency","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Cohort Studies; COVID-19; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; aged; child; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; female; hospital emergency service; hospitalization; human; immune deficiency; male; middle aged; patient attitude; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; therapy; United Kingdom; young adult","","","","","","","Krishna M.T., Et al., The impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Adult and Pediatric Allergy & Immunology Services in the UK National Health Service, J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 9, 2, pp. 709-e7222, (2021); Shields A.M., Et al., Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency in the United Kingdom, Clinical and Experimental Immunology, (2022); Ponsford M.J., Et al., A systematic review and Meta-analysis of Inpatient Mortality Associated with Nosocomial and Community COVID-19 exposes the vulnerability of immunosuppressed adults, Front Immunol, 6, 12, pp. 7446961664-3224, (2021); Pulvirenti F., Et al., Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian patients switched to Remote Assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 8, 6, pp. 1894-e18992, (2020); Grigoriadou S.A., Et al., British Society for Immunology and United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network (UKPIN) consensus guideline for the management of immunoglobulin replacement therapy, Clin Exp Immunol, 210, pp. 1-13, (2022); Elhaj M.O., Et al., Dose reductions in immunoglobulin replacement are associated with increased antibiotic usage in patients with antibody deficiency, Br J Haematol, 202, 4, pp. 900-903, (2023); Richards N., The impact of remote care on burden of treatment, BMJ, (2022); Shields A.M., Et al., SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in individuals with antibody Deficiency: Findings from the COV-AD study, J Clin Immunol, 2022, pp. 1-12; Alligon M., Et al., An appraisal of the frequency and severity of noninfectious manifestations in primary immunodeficiencies: a study of a national retrospective cohort of 1375 patients over 10 years, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 149, 6, pp. 2216-2125, (2022); Mustafa Ali M.K., Et al., Hospital admissions secondary to diseases of the blood, blood-forming organs, and Immune System in England and Wales, Cureus, 14, 10, (2022); Coignard-Biehler H.A., Et al., A 1-Year prospective French Nationwide Study of Emergency Hospital Admissions in children and adults with primary immunodeficiency, J Clin Immunol, 37, 7, pp. 702-712, (2019); Gholami K., Et al., Costs of Hospital Admission on Primary Immunodeficiency diseases, Iran J Public Health, 46, 3, pp. 342-350, (2017); Shields A.M., Et al., Impact of vaccination on hospitalization and mortality from COVID-19 in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency: the United Kingdom experience, Front Immunol, 13, (2022); Shields A.M., Et al., Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with symptomatic secondary immunodeficiency following the treatment of haematological malignancies, EJHaem, 4, 2, pp. 339-349, (2023); Ritchie B., Et al., Economic impact of self-administered subcutaneous versus clinic-administered intravenous immunoglobulin G therapy in Alberta, Canada: a population-based cohort study, Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol, 18, 1, (2022); Martin A., Et al., Economic benefits of subcutaneous rapid push versus intravenous immunoglobulin infusion therapy in adult patients with primary immune deficiency, Transfus Med, 23, 1, pp. 55-60, (2013); Alsina L., Et al., Cost-minimization analysis of immunoglobulin treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases in Spain, Eur J Health Econ, 23, 3, pp. 551-558, (2022); Patel S.Y., Carbone J., Jolles S., The Expanding Field of secondary antibody Deficiency: causes, diagnosis, and management, Front Immunol, 10, (2019); Baron U., Et al., Epigenetic immune cell counting in human blood samples for immunodiagnostics, Sci Transl Med, 10, 452, (2018); Ferentinos P., Et al., Validation of dried blood spot sampling for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and total immunoglobulins in a large cohort of asymptomatic young adults, J Immunol Methods, 518, (2023)","A.M.

When conducting an in-depth analysis of microinfection dynamics, one must account for the substantial heterogeneity across countries. However, many commonly used statistical model specifications lack the flexibility needed for sound and accurate analysis and prediction in such contexts. Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMMs) constitute a specific statistical tool that can overcome these significant challenges. While compartmental models are well-established in infectious disease modeling and have seen significant advancements, Nonlinear Mixed Models (NLMMs) offer a flexible approach for handling heterogeneous and unbalanced repeated measures data, often with less computational effort than some individual-level compartmental modeling techniques. This study provides an overview of their current use and offers a solid foundation for developing guidelines that may help improve their implementation in real-world situations. Relevant scientific databases in the Research4life Access initiative programs were used to search for papers dealing with key aspects of NLMMs in infectious disease modeling (IDM). From an initial list of 3641 papers, 124 were finally included and used for this systematic and critical review spanning the last two decades, following the PRISMA guidelines. NLMMs have evolved rapidly in the last decade, especially in IDM, with most publications dating from 2017 to 2021 (83.33%). The routine use of normality assumption appeared inappropriate for IDM, leading to a wealth of literature on NLMMs with non-normal errors and random effects under various estimation methods. We noticed that NLMMs have attracted much attention for the latest known epidemics worldwide (COVID-19, Ebola, Dengue and Lassa) with the robustness and reliability of relaxed propositions of the normality assumption. A case study of the application of COVID-19 data helped to highlight NLMMs’ performance in modeling infectious diseases. Out of this study, estimation methods, assumptions, and random terms specification in NLMMs are key aspects requiring particular attention for their application in IDM. © 2024 The Authors","Comparison; Epidemic; Heterogeneous data; Multilevel nonlinear models; PRISMA","algorithm; compartment model; conceptual framework; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis; dengue; disease model; disease transmission; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; expectation-maximization algorithm; human; implementation science; infection; Lassa fever; Markov chain Monte Carlo method; Medline; Neisseria meningitidis; nonlinear mixed model; nonlinear system; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; practice guideline; prediction; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; reliability; Review; Scopus; search engine","","","R software","","German Academic Exchange Service London, DAAD London; German Federal Foreign Office","OMA acknowledges the support from Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through the programme In-Country/In-Region Scholarship.

The best approach to forestall this pandemic is to avoid exposure to the virus. Therefore, medical protective equipment is essential for fighting this pandemic. This underlines the chief role of having a sustainable supply chain network (SCN) for producing and distributing personal protective equipment to avoid shortage and augmenting costs. The reality, however, is that the COVID-19 pandemic leads to many developments in countries and this study is another step for these purposes. This research develops a multi-period, multi-objective, multi-echelon, and multi-product medical protective equipment sustainable SCN considering the production, distribution, allocation, and inventory with “risk pooling” strategy effect with the aim of filling the existing gaps in health SCN research during the COVID-19 pandemic. By applying the risk pooling strategy, lower inventory levels or higher service levels can be achieved without increasing inventory costs. This model explores the possibility of lateral transshipments between distribution centers, as a way to increase the reliability of SCN performance. We model a new production, inventory, distribution, location, and allocation problem and consider four objectives for our suggested model (i) minimizing total SCN costs, (ii) minimizing environmental effects, (iii) minimizing social impacts, and (iv) maximizing the reliability of demand delivery. The proposed model simultaneously examines all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) as well as the reliability of demand delivery. Considering all of these decisions and assumptions brings the studied problem closer to reality. We employ various algorithms for solving our developed model with different sizes: the improved version of the augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON2) algorithm for small and medium-sized problems and two meta-heuristic algorithms, i.e., Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm (MOWOA) and Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) algorithm, for large-sized ones. The Taguchi approach is used to tune the parameters of meta-heuristic algorithms, and a comparison is performed using four evaluation metrics: Mean Ideal Distance (MID), Number of Pareto Solutions (NPS), Maximum Spread (MS), and Spread of Non-Dominance Solution (SNS). Proposed solving methods for the studied problem and making comparisons between them are another innovation of this study. A couple of numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the presented solution methods. Finally, sensitivity analysis for problem parameters is performed to validate our suggested model. Our study reveals the superiority of the MOWOA over the other algorithms. © 2024 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Metaheuristics; Reliability; Sustainable healthcare network","Health risks; Risk perception;

Stool samples from infected patients were used as endogenous viral material to more accurately mirror real-world decay processes compared to more traditionally used lab-propagated spike-ins. As such, this study includes data on early decay stages of endogenous viral targets in wastewaters that are typically overlooked when performing decay studies on wastewaters harvested from wastewater treatment plants that contain already-degraded endogenous material. The two distinct sewer transport conditions of dynamic suspended sewer transport and bed and near-bed sewer transport were simulated in this study at temperatures of 4 °C, 12 °C and 20 °C to elucidate decay under these two dominant transport conditions within wastewater infrastructure. The dynamic suspended sewer transport was simulated over 35 h, representing typical flow conditions, whereas bed and near-bed transport extended to 60 days to reflect the prolonged settling of solids in sewer systems during reduced flow periods. In dynamic suspended sewer transport, no decay was observed for SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, or total RNA over the 35-h period, and temperature ranging from 4 °C to 20 °C had no noticeable effect. Conversely, experiments simulating bed and near-bed transport conditions revealed significant decreases in SARS-CoV-2 and total RNA concentrations by day 2, and PMMoV concentrations by day 3. Only PMMoV exhibited a clear trend of increasing decay constant with higher temperatures, suggesting that while temperature influences decay dynamics, its impact may be less significant than previously assumed, particularly for endogenous RNA that is bound to dissolved organic matter in wastewater. First order decay models were inadequate for accurately fitting decay curves of SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and total RNA in bed and near-bed transport conditions. F-tests confirmed the superior fit of the two-phase decay model compared to first order decay models across temperatures of 4 °C–20 °C. Finally, and most importantly, total RNA normalization emerged as an appropriate approach for correcting the time decay of SARS-CoV-2 exposed to bed and near-bed transport conditions. These findings highlight the importance of considering decay from the point of entry in the sewers, sewer transport conditions, and normalization strategies when assessing and modelling the impact of viral decay rates in wastewater systems. This study also emphasizes the need for ongoing research into the diverse and multifaceted factors that influence these decay rates, which is crucial for accurate public health monitoring and response strategies. © 2024","Bed transport; Decay rate; Degradation testing; Persistence testing; Stool spike-in; Wastewater-based surveillance","","","","","","","","Ahmed W., Angel N., Edson J., Bibby K., Bivins A., O'Brien J.W., Choi P.M., Kitajima M., Simpson S.L., Li J., Tscharke B., Verhagen R., Smith W.J.M., Zaugg J., Dierens L., Hugenholtz P., Thomas K.V., Mueller J.F., First confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewater in Australia: a proof of concept for the wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 in the community, Sci.

Recently, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become severe global pandemic. Particularly, the Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has become an essentiality in COVID-19 detection. As a result, the convergence of CADx technology with Chest X-ray analysis has achieved great efficiency in COVID-19 diagnosis. Therefore, the research value of CADx in COVID-19 diagnosis is exceptionally high. This study aims to evaluate different k-means based clustering algorithms and identifying the one with the highest overall accuracy. First of all, 150 COVID-19 CXR open-source images are acquired from Kaggle and Github. All the images will be unified into a same image size with 1000*1000 pixels and quality during the image pre-processing. Next, the resized images are enhanced by the Modified Global Contrast Stretching (MGCS) enhancement method to increase the quality of images. Then, the traditional k-means, k-medians, k-medoids and fast k-means clustering methods have been implemented in the image segmentation. At the same time, five different numbers <2, 4, 6, 8, 10> of clusters also tested out in this study. Lastly, all the segmented is proceeded to the segmentation performance based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, recall and F-score. The result proves that the k-medoids clustering algorithm with 2 clusters archived the best overall segmentation performance as it obtained the highest sensitivity, accuracy, recall and F-score with 66.14%, 87.98%, 0.6614 and 0.7327. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

We modelled the information transfers across different periods of global shocks – the Federal Reserve Bank normalisation post the Global Financial Crisis, oil price shocks, BREXIT, the U.S.-China trade war, and COVID-19. Information interactions from advanced to African markets were moderate, occasionally mixed, and insignificant, leaving room for portfolio diversification. We also discovered some progress regarding the integration process between the developed and African markets on the back of noticeable information exchanges. Our findings from the information exchanges indicate that the stock markets of South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya have led the integration process ahead of their peers. To robust-check our results, we employed the wavelet multiple correlation (WMC) technique by modelling the multi-structure relationship among all the stock markets and confirmed the fast integration between the South African stock market and the developed markets. Our WMC results also revealed that portfolio diversification opportunities are feasible in the short term. The results present important implications for optimal risk management strategies and policy measures to anchor markets to withstand shocks. © 2024 The Authors","Advanced markets; African stocks; Entropy; Information transfer","","","","","","","","Aderibigbe T., Adegboye K., Osayi V., Okorie S., Iyang E., Opportunities and problems of investment in the african stock exchange: a selection of NSE, GSE, & RSE, J.

How can these solutions influence cognitive processes and responses, leading to positive results for brands and their customers? The research seeks to answer the question through a qualitative experimental research, bringing together participants from different generations in order to provide an inclusive overview of user behavior when faced with these solutions. The sample of twenty-five volunteers was distributed equally into five different groups or generations: Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y, and Generation Z. With the aim of understanding and tracing experience through the users’ perspective, the experiments included a questionnaire and focus group session, which included the application of complementary techniques, as the Experience Compelling Map, to ensure greater reliability in results. Through this study, a general and inclusive overlook of consumer behavior was obtained as well as an integrated overview of the topic, providing a better understanding for both non-specialists and specialists and contributing to Design practice. The results were compared and generated fourteen guidelines that can become alternatives to enhance physical retail experience. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

This study aims to analyse virtual laboratory research trends for practical learning in vocational education through bibliometric analysis by taking data from Scopus (intro/issue). The method used in this bibliometric journal article is the bibliometric method. This research step consists of (i) determining search keywords, (ii) collection of publication data, (iii) bibliometric data processing, (iv) bibliometric data mapping, and (v) data analysis. The search keywords used to collect data were ""Virtual laboratory,"" ""Vocational,"" and ""Education."" There are 31 articles indexed by Scopus from 2002 to 2023. From 2019 to 2023, research on virtual laboratories in vocational education has increased. This is because access to computer technology, the internet, and mobile devices is increasingly widespread, and a surge in technology use occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the bibliometric mapping analysis show there are 24 terms grouped into 3 clusters. The terms virtual laboratory and vocational education are related in research. Virtual laboratories help overcome problems in vocational education, especially for productive vocational subjects such as working on dangerous equipment. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Our model has K+4 compartments. K-1 of these compartments represent additional subsequent vaccination stages not considered in the original SVIR model, while a further compartment accounts for dead people. We analyze the equilibrium points of the model. A time-varying parameters version of it, having K=3 vaccination compartments, is then calibrated to Italian COVID-19 dataset. This analysis is carried out for three specific sub-periods: the first one, ranging from February 24th, 2020, up to December 26th 2020, when no vaccines were available; the second one, from the December 27th, 2020 up to December 31st, 2021, during which the Delta variant of the virus prevailed and Delta-targeted vaccination doses were administered to the population for the first time; finally, the last considered period is ranging from January 10th, 2022 up to June 3rd, 2022, and it was characterized by the diffusion of the Omicron variant. To tackle the problem of undetected infected or undetected recovered people we adopt an approach relying on different scenarios. The calibration of the model uses the property that the discrete-time version of it turns out to be explicitly solvable with respect to the parameters, hence providing a daily estimate of the involved parameters. This produces meaningful evolution patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic which allow a better understanding of the diffusive behavior of the pandemic along time. Lastly a statistical analysis of the epidemiological parameters estimators supports the non stationarity of their time series. © 2024 The Author(s)","Compartmental epidemic models; Covid-19; Dynamic simulations; Equilibrium states","Digital elevation model; Macroinvertebrates; Compartmental epidemic model; Compartmental modelling; Covid-19; Dynamics simulation; Epidemic modeling; Equilibrium point; Equilibrium state; Generalisation; ITS applications; Time varying parameter; COVID-19","","","","","","","Liu X., Takeuchi Y., Iwami S., SVIR epidemic models with vaccination strategies, J.

As a result of COVID-19, the construction industry has experienced its fair share of supply chain interruptions of small equipment, tools, and consumables (SETCs) leading to productivity loss as well as cost and schedule overruns on many projects. Proactively managing supply chains can help avoid frequent handling, expedited shipping, and overstocking of SETCs. Optimizing the value supply chain on construction projects has therefore been harboring increasing interest from the Canadian construction industry. The current approach for managing and forecasting SETCs’ demand heavily relies on individual field experts’ experience and judgment causing inconsistency among the projects within one organization. Yet, little research has been directed toward a supply chain planning and forecasting perspective for these types of indirect resources. Construction supply chain research has focused on the demand and supply of direct resources such as material and labor while dismissing SETCs although they constitute a considerable portion of project costs and are essential prerequisites to performing any construction task. Given these setbacks in research and practice, this study aims to develop a data-driven forecast solution for SETCs throughout an industrial construction project’s lifecycle. This study documents the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including data visualization, data wrangling, data modeling, and investigation of all possible correlations, underlying structures, and insights within a historical dataset provided by an industry partner. The EDA revealed that most orders are placed at the beginning of the project regardless of when the demand for them is needed. A deep neural network was further developed to forecast the demand quantity and request date for different SETCs. By accurately forecasting the demand for SETCs, project managers can avoid delays and workflow interruptions resulting from late deliveries. Moreover, they can mitigate indirect costs associated with early overstocking of SETCs including storing, handling, maintaining, and transporting them. This analysis and forecasting model can improve the flexibility, agility, and resilience of SETCs supply chains and aid decision-makers in balancing demand/supply schedules. To facilitate further study, additional data such as project type, crew size and labor hours, and work package schedules are needed. © Canadian Society for Civil Engineering 2025.","Artificial intelligence; Construction supply chain; Consumables; Demand forecasting; Neural network","Benchmarking; Costs; Data encapsulation; Deep neural networks; Industrial relations; Information management; Network security; Project management; Supply chain management; Construction projects; Construction sectors; Construction supply chain; Consumables; Demand forecasting; Exploratory data analysis; Industrial construction; Neural-networks; Small equipment; Supply chain analysis; Decision making","","","","","","","Koeleman J., Ribeirinho M.J., Rockhill D., Sjodin E., Strube G., Decoding digital transformation in construction, Capital Projects & Infrastructure Practice.

Results based on 143 correlations from 65 studies indicated that employee perceptions of CSR are related to antecedents including transformational, ethical, and servant leadership, as well as related to outcomes including firm performance, reputation, employee psychological states, and behavioural responses. The study examined potential moderating variables including national culture, industry type, and COVID-19 pandemic phase. This meta-analytic research promotes the advancement of the employee perceptions of CSR literature and provides effective guidance for managers to understand CSR practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Antecedents; Employee perceptions of CSR; Meta-analysis; Moderation; Outcomes","behavioral response; corporate social responsibility; cultural influence; employment; environmental economics; hospitality industry; industrial performance; leadership; meta-analysis; perception; psychology; social behavior; tourism; tourism management","","","","","Jinan University Shenzhen Tourism College’ s Health Tourism Research Center; Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences; Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Sciences, (2023GZYB32); Shenzhen Philosophy and Social Sciences Funds, (SZ2024B020); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72072098, 72072099); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2023M731312); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (23JNQMX42); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Jinan University Shenzhen Campus Funding Program, (JNSZQH2301)","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72072099, No. 72072098), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 23JNQMX42), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2023M731312), Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Sciences \u201C14th Five-Year Plan\u201D Funds (No. 2023GZYB32), Shenzhen Philosophy and Social Sciences Funds (No. SZ2024B020), Jinan University Shenzhen Campus Funding Program (No. JNSZQH2301) and Jinan University Shenzhen Tourism College\u2019 s Health Tourism Research Center.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72072099), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 23JNQMX42), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2023M731312), Guangdong Philosophy and Social Sciences (No.GD24YGL21), Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Sciences \u201C14th Five-Year Plan\u201D Funds (No. 2023GZYB32), Shenzhen Philosophy and Social Sciences Funds (No. SZ2024B020) and Jinan University Shenzhen Campus Funding Program (No. JNSZQH2301).

However, it also contributes to environmental degradation, particularly in terms of air quality, which impacts public health. This research applies the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, a sustainability matrix, to gauge the environmental impact of Jakarta's public transportation system. Our study aims to identify car emissions and understand the environmental consequences they pose. The research was scoped to examine both the raw materials and energy input and the resultant emissions. Specifically, we analyzed the electricity consumption of Jakarta's MRT, Bus Trans Jakarta, and online taxi services. We utilized the LCA methodology and the SimaPro 9.1 software for assessment. Prior research data were incorporated to enhance the accuracy of our LCA model. A notable observation is the decline in public transportation usership since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Current health protocols allow only half the usual passenger capacity, compounded by a sluggish economy. Our findings reveal that the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT)'s CO2 emissions, at 0.019 kg/passenger/kilometer, are significantly lower than that of the BRT at 0.036 kg/passenger/kilometer. One recommendation to further reduce emissions is to transition buses from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel. However, public adoption of these changes will largely hinge on individual preferences. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

The change in the learning model must also be supported by supporting learning devices and media, including computer networks and the internet in schools, the network that is used to support online learning is currently widely used by schools using WLAN, because it can reach parts of the hard one. The use of WLAN learning devices and media as a support for online learning can be an obstacle for some teachers and students, this is because not all teachers and students can understand the online learning system and not all areas have a fast internet access network, with these constraints in need a technology acceptance measurement model (TAM) for online learning using WLAN, so that online learning can be carried out properly and the achievement of successful learning can be carried out. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Mathematical models assessing past booster campaigns and integrating knowledge on waning of immunity can help better inform current and future vaccination programs. Focusing on the first booster campaign in the 2021/2022 winter in France, we used a multi-strain age-stratified transmission model to assess the effectiveness of the observed booster vaccination in controlling the succession of Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves. We explored counterfactual scenarios altering the eligibility criteria and inter-dose delay. Our study showed that the success of the immunization program in curtailing the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 waves was largely dependent on the inclusion of adults among the eligible groups, and was highly sensitive to the inter-dose delay, which was changed over time. Shortening or prolonging this delay, even by only one month, would have required substantial social distancing interventions to curtail the hospitalization peak. Also, the time window for adjusting the delay was very short. Our findings highlight the importance of readiness and adaptation in the formulation of routine booster campaign in the current level of epidemiological uncertainty. © 2024 The Authors","Age-structured model; COVID-19; Immunity waning; Inter-dose delay; Vaccination strategies","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; compartment model; coronavirus disease 2019; disease activity; disease burden; epidemic; female; herd immunity; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; human experiment; immunity; immunization; incidence; infant; innate immunity; male; middle aged; newborn; prevalence; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2 (lineage BA.1); SARS-CoV-2 (lineage BA.2); SARS-CoV-2 Delta; sensitivity analysis; seroconversion; social distancing; stochastic model; vaccination; virus transmission","","","","","HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme; Horizon Therapeutics; Horizon 2020, (H2020-874850, MOOD105); Horizon 2020; VERDI, (101045989); ESCAPE, (101095619); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03, ANRS0151); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","This study was partially funded by: Agence Nationale de la Recherche project DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03) to VC; ANRS\u2013Maladies Infectieuses \u00C9mergentes project EMERGEN (ANRS0151) to VC; Horizon Europe grant ESCAPE (101095619) to VC; EU HORIZON grant VERDI (101045989); EU Horizon 2020 grant MOOD (H2020-874850) to VC.

Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for PF. ShaShen-MaiDong decoction (SMT), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been employed in treating various lung diseases, which may offer potential therapeutic benefits for PF. Aim of the study: To investigate the antifibrotic efficacy of SMT and its major active ingredients as well as the underlying mechanisms for treating PF. Materials and methods: Fist, we build the UPLC-MS based qualitative and quantitative profiling for the quality control of SMT. Then, the antifibrotic efficacy of SMT was investigated in bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF mice model. Network pharmacology was used to predict the mechanism and active components of SMT for the treatment of PF, which was further verified in vitro and in vivo. Results: SMT improved the weight loss and attenuated hydroxyproline, inflammatory cytokines, and collagen deposition in BLM-induced PF mice model in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, as predicted by network pharmacology analysis, SMT and its active compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin) regulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, and YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which was further verified in the PF mice and TGF-β-induced A549 cell model. Moreover, SMT balanced the proportions of increased CD4+ and decreased CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of PF mice model. Conclusions: Considering the high mortality and complex pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases, our results provide novel evidence that SMT would be beneficial for pulmonary fibrosis therapy by modulating MAPK, TGF-β/Smad, and YAP/TAZ signaling pathways at same time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Active ingredients; MAPK; Pulmonary fibrosis; ShaShen-MaiDong decoction; TGF-β/Smad; YAP/TAZ","alpha smooth muscle actin; bleomycin; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; Chinese medicinal formula; collagen; collagen type 1; fibronectin; hydroxyproline; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; isorhamnetin; kaempferol; mammalian target of rapamycin; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; pirfenidone; protein kinase B; protein p42; protein p44; quercetin; ShaShen Maidong decoction; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif protein; transforming growth factor beta; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; YAP signaling protein; A-549 cell line; Akt signaling; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antifibrotic activity; antifibrotic therapy; Article; bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis; body weight loss; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; dose response; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lung parenchyma; male; MAPK signaling; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; regulatory mechanism; Smad signaling; systems pharmacology; TGF beta signaling","","bleomycin, 11056-06-7, 9041-93-4; collagen, 9007-34-5; fibronectin, 86088-83-7; hydroxyproline, 51-35-4, 6912-67-0; isorhamnetin, 480-19-3; kaempferol, 520-18-3; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; pirfenidone, 53179-13-8; protein kinase B, 148640-14-6; quercetin, 117-39-5; Smad2 protein, 253862-89-4; Smad3 protein, 237417-78-6, 237417-96-8, 237418-00-7","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFC0867500); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; State Key Laboratory of Dampness Syndrome of Chinese Medicine in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, (SZ2022KF08)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (2022YFC0867500) and the State Key Laboratory of Dampness Syndrome of Chinese Medicine in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (File no.

As a result, the current study aims to investigate the effect of student motivation on grouping e-learning in the ethics and civilization course. A total of 88 students from agriculture, fishing, and forestry were chosen to participate in the experiment. Students participated in online synchronous lectures for seven weeks and another seven weeks in online group presentations. After 14 weeks, students were given the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivation model questionnaire to assess their motivation on the course. As a result, the ARCS questionnaire score was 4.62, indicating that student learning motivation was adequate. Furthermore, forestry students outperformed agricultural and fishery students in terms of ARCS model score. Male students who participated in the online grouping presentation had the greatest ARCS model score compared to female students. As a result, using an online group presentation learning system for asynchronous learning is possible and beneficial, particularly for male learners. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

Based on the political promotion tournament model, this article theorizes that China’s strict administrative accountability system, which tied local officials’ career prospects to their performance in crucial policy goals, incentivized local governments to sustain COVID-19 policies. Using data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and major official Chinese media outlets, we performed interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) to examine whether the accountability events affected the local government’s COVID-19 responses. Noticeably, our analyses found that from May 4, 2020, to September 30, 2022, when an accountability event happened, officials in the affected (local effects) and unaffected (spillover effects) provinces all increased their containment responses and decreased their economic support responses. This is true even for provinces without new localized outbreaks. The effects of accountability events increased with decreasing geographical distance. These findings remain consistent after several robustness checks. The administrative accountability system is a key institutional factor in implementing China’s zero-COVID strategy, which contributed to the global literature about the pandemic policy process in centralized countries. © 2024 The Author(s).

We investigate the impact of financial analysts on a firm's stock price resilience. We find that firms in the Chinese stock market with higher analyst coverage were more resilient during the COVID-19 crisis and had lower pandemic-induced stock price declines, shorter decline and recovery periods, and higher recovery probability. This positive relationship is more prominent for firms with strong star analyst coverage and does not depend on ownership type or firm size. Moreover, analysts help firms attract attention from media and institutional investors, improve corporate governance by improving information disclosure quality (especially for private information), and reduce financial constraints, in turn, firms’ ability to absorb pandemic shocks improves. Overall, we demonstrate that financial analysts play a crucial role in shaping a firm's stock price resilience during crises, particularly for firms with strong star analyst coverage. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Analyst coverage; Corporate governance; Corporate resilience; Financial constraints; Investor attention; Stock price resilience","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21AJL012); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","Cancan, WANG acknowledges that this work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China [grant numbers 21AJL012].

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","Background: Significant early life adversities, such as childhood sexual and physical/emotional abuse, are associated with risk of poor health outcomes but are understudied risk factors for post-COVID-19 conditions. In this prospective study, we examined the associations between combined exposure to sexual and physical/emotional abuse during childhood with risk of post-COVID-19 conditions in adulthood. Additionally, we explored the extent to which lifestyle, health-related and psychological factors explain this association. Methods: We used data from three large, ongoing cohorts: Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)-II, NHS3, and the Growing Up Today Study. Between April 2020 and November 2021, participants responded to periodic COVID-19 surveys. Participants were included if they responded to a questionnaire about childhood abuse, subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and responded to questions about post-COVID-19 conditions. Childhood sexual abuse was measured before the COVID-19 pandemic with the Sexual Maltreatment Scale of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale, and physical/emotional abuse was measured with the Physical and Emotional Abuse Subscale of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Post-COVID-19 conditions, defined as COVID–19–related symptoms lasting 4 weeks or longer (e.g., fatigue, dyspnea), were self-reported in the final COVID-19 questionnaire in November 2021. Sexual abuse and physical/emotional abuse were examined separately and jointly in relation to post-COVID-19 conditions. Data on key lifestyle (e.g., cigarette smoking), health-related (e.g., asthma, diabetes), and psychological factors (e.g., depression and anxiety) were obtained. Results: Of 2851 participants, the mean age (range) was 55.8 (22.0–75.0) years; 2789 (97.8 %) were females, and 2750 (96.5 %) were whites. We observed a dose-dependent relationship between severity of childhood abuse and post-COVID conditions (p-trend:<0.0001); participants with severe versus no childhood abuse had a 42 % higher subsequent risk of post-COVID conditions [relative risk (95 % confidence interval): 1.42 (1.25 to 1.61)]. Key lifestyle, health-related, and psychological factors mediated 25.5 % of this association. Both sexual and physical/emotional abuse, were independently associated with post-COVID conditions. Conclusions: In this prospective study of 2851 participants, childhood abuse was significantly associated with increased risk of post-COVID conditions. Biological pathways connecting childhood abuse with subsequent risk of post-COVID conditions should be investigated. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Childhood abuse; Long COVID; Physical and emotional abuse; Post-COVID-19 conditions; Sexual abuse","adult; aged; anxiety; Article; asthma; child abuse; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; cohort analysis; depression; diabetes mellitus; dyspnea; educational status; emotional abuse; emotional stress; fatigue; female; health care personnel; human; hypertension; International Index of Erectile Function; long COVID; major clinical study; male; middle aged; parent child conflict tactics scale; Patient Health Questionnaire 2; Patient Health Questionnaire 4; prospective study; questionnaire; risk assessment; sexual maltreatment scale; social support; UCLA Loneliness Scale; vaccine hesitancy","","","","","Broad Institute, BI; Harvard T.H.

It was a delight to talk to and be with others who feel equally passionate about early childhood education and care (ECEC). What struck me during the conference was the immense hope and optimism delegates brought to the symposia, discussions and keynote speeches in spite of the difficult times we find ourselves in. In particular, Michel Vandenbroeck’s comments towards the end of his symposium have stayed with me: He agreed that the context in which we find early childhood practice is not an easy one. Nonetheless, he was looking forward – the time may not be right for big changes now but the right time will come, and we need to be ready for it. In addition, I firmly believe that even small changes can make a difference and in the long run build considerable change, for example, when we offer children more outdoor play or when we shift our language to be more inclusive. This is the spirit which drives this book, and two questions are at its core: What is the current state in which we find early childhood education and care, and what can we learn from recent events, crises and developments to work towards a better future and to be prepared for further challenges when they come?. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Ute Ward; individual chapters, the contributors.

Immature coping strategies can worsen mental health outcomes. Methods: This study utilised a two-wave cross-sectional survey design with data collected from Chinese youth aged 14–25 years. Wave 1 (N = 3038) and Wave 2 (N = 539) datasets were used for model development and external validation, respectively. Twenty-five features, encompassing dimensions related to demographic information, stressful life events, social support, coping strategies, and emotional intelligence, were input into the model to predict the mental health status of youth, which was considered their coping outcome. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was used to determine the importance of each risk factor in the feature selection. The intersection of top 10 features identified by random forest and XGBoost were considered the most influential predictors of mental health during the feature selection process, and was then taken as the final set of features for model development. Machine learning models, including logistic regression, AdaBoost, and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), were trained to predict the outcomes. The optimum model was selected according to the performance in both internal and external validation. Results: This study identified six key features that were significantly associated with mental health outcomes: punishment, adaptation issues, self-regulation of emotions, learning pressure, use of social support, and recognition of others' emotions. The BPNN model, optimized through feature selection methods like SHAP, demonstrated superior performance in internal validation (C-index [95 % CI] = 0.9120 [0.9111, 0.9129], F-score [95 % CI] = 0.8861 [0.8853, 0.8869]). Additionally, external validation showed the model had strong discrimination (C-index = 0.9749, F-score = 0.8442) and calibration (Brier score = 0.029) capabilities. Limitations: Although the clinical prediction model performed well, the study it still limited by self-reported data and representativeness of samples. Causal relationships need to be established to interpret the coping mechanism from multiple perspectives. Also, the limited data on minority groups may lead to algorithmic unfairness. Conclusions: Machine learning models effectively identified and predicted mental health outcomes among youths, with the SHAP+BPNN model showing promising clinical applicability. These findings emphasise the importance and effectiveness of targeted interventions with the help of clinical prediction model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Mental health; Prediction model; Stressful life events; Youth","adaptation; adolescent; adult; Article; autoregulation; back propagation neural network; calibration; clinical outcome; controlled study; coping; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; demographics; emotion regulation; emotional awareness; emotional intelligence; feature selection; female; health hazard; human; juvenile; life event; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mental health; pandemic; performance; prediction; prevalence; punishment; random forest; sensitivity analysis; Shapley additive explanation; social support","","","","","Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao University Alliance for Nursing; School of Nursing at Sun Yat-sen University; Anhui Office of Philosophy and Social Science, (GD22YSH06); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2024A1515012147); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (2023A1414020019); National College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fund, (202310558091)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Guangdong Provincial Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (Xia Wei, GD22YSH06), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (Xia Wei, 2024A1515012147), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (Xia Wei, 2023A1414020019), National College Students' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fund (Hexiao Ding, 202310558091)8091).We are grateful to the School of Nursing at Sun Yat-sen University for their full support of this project.

All the schools, colleges and universities adopted new technology in teaching-learning pedagogy. Academicians and students were taught to practice online education with many challenges and difficulties. The Constitution of India includes many beneficial provisions to promote the integral development of scheduled tribes. It enables them and protects them from socioeconomic status and forms of exploitation. In Kerala, the Scheduled Tribes Development Department is implementing various programs for the educational, social and economic development of Scheduled Tribes. Kerala is the most literate state in India. It creates a strong academic foundation at the school level. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world, the government continued education in the state through the VICTERS educational television channel with the help of various ICT tools. This study’s objective is to determine the challenges faced by tribal students in the Idukki District of Kerala State in online education and to understand the social and technological challenges they face in the learning process. An in-depth interview method was adopted for the study. This qualitative study explored the perspectives of teachers who teach tribal students. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

Using a sample of listed firms between 2015 and 2021, we find that promoter control positively relates to dividends during normal (pre-crisis) times. This is attributed to the desire to communicate information about the firm's prospects, supporting the signaling theory. The positive relationship is inversed during the crisis owing to agency motives of withholding resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever India-based study examining ownership structure's impacts on the dividend policy during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 Pandemic; Dividend policy; India; Promoter","","","","","","","","Abdullah H., Isiksal A.Z., Rasul R., Dividend policy and firm value: evidence of financial firms from Borsa Istanbul under the IFRS adoption, J.

In this study, to examine relationships between race, perceived discrimination, transit use, and walking behavior, we draw on data collected in 20 waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) COVID-19 tracking survey, fielded July 2020–July 2021. Importantly, we find that transit use among minorities continued during the pandemic at higher rates, especially among Black and Hispanic respondents, despite non-White respondents reporting more frequent perceptions of discrimination. Our linear mixed-effect model results further indicate that non-White respondents were notably more likely to use transit. Examining walking behavior, we find that White and Asian respondents consistently reported more walking than Black and Hispanic respondents, even when controlling for income. Crucially, we found that in the presence of controls, while large disparities were observed in both walking and transit behavior based on race, perceived discrimination had little to no effect. While disparities in travel behavior based on race are evidently better explained by structural factors as opposed to overt, individual-level discrimination, planners, policymakers, and designers should nevertheless give greater consideration to micro- and macro-scale interventions that facilitate safe transit use and walking for racial and ethnic minorities. © 2024 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies","COVID-19; Discrimination; Transit; Understanding America Study; Walking","","","","","","University of Southern California, USC; National Institute on Aging, NIA; Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (U01AG054580); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF","The project described in this paper relies on data from survey(s) administered by the Understanding America Study, which is maintained by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California.

A multinomial Logit model was estimated with data from the National Financial Inclusion Survey corresponding to 2021 and 2018. The results show a significant increase of 5.76% of people who saved formally for retirement in 2021 compared to 2018 and a decrease 3.91% of those who saved informally. There is evidence that supports the hypotheses of the positive and significant effect of financial literacy and financial education on retirement savings. Except for having a sophisticated account, the change in retirement savings was based on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The results highlight the importance of financial literacy and financial education in people's ability to face the uncertainty generated by a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2025 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

However, little is known about the effect of these exceptional heatwaves on mortality in Europe, especially since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which converges with climate change to affect healthcare systems and human lives. We collected mortality data of 967 regions in 30 European countries over the last decade (2014–2023) from the Eurostat. A standard time-series analysis was used to estimate the effect of exceptional heatwaves by quasi-Poisson regression model, including the main effect (effect from heatwave intensity) and the added effect (effect from heatwave duration), on mortality for each region during two periods (before and since the COVID-19 outbreak). We used random effects meta-analysis to pool the mortality risk (i.e., relative risk [RR]) and burden (i.e., attributable fraction [AF]) associated with exceptional heatwaves, at the country level and for Europe as a whole. In Europe, the mortality burden attributable to main and added effects increased from 0.492% (95% CI: 0.488%–0.496%) to 1.276% (95% CI: 1.266%–1.285%) and from 0.307% (95% CI: 0.294%–0.318%) to 0.428% (95% CI: 0.407%–0.448%), respectively. Furthermore, substantial variations across countries were observed, with some countries such as France and Spain experiencing a large increase in the mortality burden attributable to exceptional heatwaves since the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings underscore the urgent need for heat-health actions to consider the multi-effects of exceptional heatwaves amidst a warming climate. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus disease 2019; Heatwaves; Mortality","Breakings; Coronaviruses; European Countries; Healthcare systems; Heatwaves; Hot weather; Human health; Human lives; Mortality; Standard time; COVID-19","","","","","","","Achebak H., Devolder D., Ballester J., Trends in temperature-related age-specific and sex-specific mortality from cardiovascular diseases in Spain: a national time-series analysis, Lancet Planet.

The evaluation of current sustainable development efforts and the identification of effective green financial tools are critical for Vietnam's progress. This study introduces the Sustainable Economic Development (SED) Index, a comprehensive measure of sustainable economic development quality across Vietnam's 63 provinces from 2015 to 2022. Using a range of analytical techniques, we explore the relationships between green credit, environmental pollution, and sustainable economic development during this period. Our findings indicate rapid growth in sustainable economic development until 2019, followed by a deceleration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. Green credit emerges as a pivotal factor in supporting sustainable economic growth, managing climate risks, and mitigating environmental pollution, particularly during times of uncertainty. Additionally, we observe spatial spillover effects, where the benefits of green credit and the challenges of environmental pollution transcend provincial boundaries. The study recommends promoting green credit policies, fostering regional cooperation, and enhancing local competitiveness, digital transformation, and social equality to advance Vietnam's journey toward sustainable economic development. © 2024 The Authors","Climate risk; Environmental pollution; Green credit; Green finance; Sustainable economic development; Vietnam","","","","","","Đại học Kinh tế Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh; UEH, (2023-12-21-2023)","Funding text 1: This paper is funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. ; Funding text 2: This research is funded by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (UEH) under Grant No. 2023-12-21-2023.","Ahmed R., Chen X.H., Hoang Y.H., Do-Linh C., Climate change effects and their implications for the financial markets: evidence from the United Kingdom, J.

In this work, we explored the potential of oversulfated kappa-carrageenan (OSKC) in spray-coated facemasks for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition pathway. The sulfated derivative was synthesized with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex in dimethylformamide solution. The antiviral efficacy of OSKC at different concentrations and spray-coated facemasks was evaluated using betacoronavirus Murine Hepatitis Virus strain 3, revealing a significant reduction in viral load compared to commercial kappa-carrageenan. Furthermore, the characterization techniques assessed the effect of the position of the introduced sulfate groups on the antiviral activity and on the physicochemical characteristics. OSKC is able to bind specific proteins of enveloped viruses, preventing viral attachment into target cells. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of OSKC spray coating for breathable facemasks with antimicrobial properties, offering a promising approach to enhancing personal protective equipment against viral transmission in healthcare and community settings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Antiviral activity; COVID-19; Kappa-carrageenan; Oversulfation; Spray coating","COVID-19; Dimethylformamide; Anti-viral effects; Antiviral activities; Antivirals; Coating application; Kappa carrageenan; Oversulphation; Spray coating; Sulfur trioxide; Sulphated derivatives; Synthesised","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; CAPES-EPIDEMIAS, (88887.505220/2020-00); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (308046/2019-6, 403560/2021-7, 401767/2022-1); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This work was financially supported by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - CAPES (CAPES-EPIDEMIAS Emergency Project, grant number 88887.505220/2020-00 ) \u2013 Finance Code 001, and National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [grant numbers 308046/2019-6 , 403560/2021-7 and 401767/2022-1 ].

This study used a cross-sectional design with an online questionnaire. A “bespoke questionnaire” was developed for this study by the researcher. It comprised nineteen items that looked at attitudes toward the pandemic, answered on a six-point Likert scale. A factor analysis using the principal components method with direct oblimin rotation, found a two-factor solution. Factor 1 had ten items and was labeled “Faith as a protection against COVID-19.” Factor 2 had nine items and was labeled “Emotional reactions to COVID-19.” The internal reliability of Factor 1 was .85 and .82 for Factor 2. The individual item with the highest score was Question 3, “My religion has guidance relating to positive comments which assist in having a positive outlook on life.” This had a score of 5.48/6.00. The top seven scoring items were all from Factor 1, showing the importance of faith for this population. Age and gender were not found to have any significant impact on the dependent variables. In response to the three open-ended questions, it was clear that the greatest challenge for this group of people during COVID-19 was not being able to see their extended family. In contrast, the greatest benefit was being able to spend more quality time with immediate family.

However, accumulating data suggests that COVID-19 is a systemic microvascular endothelial dysfunction with different clinical manifestations. In this study, a microvascular function was assessed in long COVID patients (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 30) using flow-mediated skin fluorescence technique (FMSF), based on measurements of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide fluorescence intensity during brachial artery occlusion (ischemic response, IR) and immediately after occlusion (hyperemic response, HR). Microcirculatory function readings were taken twice, 3 months apart. In addition, we quantified biochemical markers such as the serum L-arginine derivatives and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) to assess their relation with microvascular parameters evaluated in vivo. In patients with long COVID, serum HIF1α was significantly correlated to IRindex (r = −0.375, p < 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant inverse correlation of serum asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine levels to both HRmax (r = −0.343, p < 0.05) and HRindex (r = −0.335, p < 0.05). The IR parameters were found lower or negative in long COVID patients and recovered in three-month follow-up. Hypoxia sensitivity value was significantly higher in long COVID patients examined after three months of treatment based on the combination of ACE-inhibitors and beta-adrenolytic compared to baseline condition (85.2 ± 73.8 vs. 39.9 ± 51.7 respectively, p = 0.009). This study provides evidence that FMSF is a sensitive, non-invasive technique to track changes in microvascular function that was impaired in long COVID and recovered after 3 months, especially in patients receiving a cardioprotective therapy. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Endothelium; Flow mediated skin fluorescence; Long COVID; Microcirculation; NADH fluorescence","arginine derivative; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; adult; artery occlusion; Article; blood vessel function; brachial artery occlusion; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; evidence based practice; female; flow mediated skin fluorescence technique; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence intensity; follow up; heart protection; human; in vivo study; long COVID; male; microcirculation; population research; treatment duration","","","","","Cardiac Diagnostic Department of Medical University Gdansk; Gdański Uniwersytet Medyczny, MUG","Funding text 1: The research was partially supported by statutory funds of the Cardiac Diagnostic Department of Medical University Gdansk . ; Funding text 2: The research was partially supported by statutory funds of the Deparment of Cardiac Diagnostics of Medical University of Gdansk.","Al-Aly Z., Xie Y., Bowe B., High-dimensional characterization of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, Nature, 594, pp. 259-264, (2021); Bai F., Tomasoni D., Falcinella C., Barbanotti D., Castoldi R., Mule G., Monforte A.D.A., Female gender is associated with long COVID syndrome: a prospective cohort study, Clin.

To address these issues, a new pulmonary diseases diagnostic framework named BSD is proposed, the innovations of which are: Firstly, three steps of bone suppression, pulmonary parenchyma extraction and pulmonary diseases diagnosis are included. The first two steps can eliminate the influence of bone structures and other tissues. Therefore, better diagnostic results can be obtained based on the extracted boneless pulmonary parenchyma. Secondly, aiming at the characteristics of the chest X-ray image, a new segmentation network named IU-Net is proposed for the pulmonary extraction, in which the original convolution layers of U-Net are replaced by our new designed function modules. Finally, based on the characteristic of boneless pulmonary parenchyma, an enhanced functional module RCA which can better extract the image features is designed, therefore improved the disease diagnosis. In the experiments on the chest X-ray pneumonia datasets, the framework achieved satisfied results in the binary classification with an accuracy and Kappa of 98.73% and 96.80%, respectively. And in the multi-classification task on the COVID-19 radiology database, it achieved an accuracy and Kappa of 95.76% and 95.75%, respectively, which is better than the state-of-the-art.

Our empirical findings show that return connectedness has become even stronger after the outbreak of COVID-19, with both green bonds and cryptocurrency indices acting as net receivers of return spillovers. Surprisingly, Copper functioned as a net sender of return spillovers over the entire observation period. Findings revealed that the cryptocurrency index exhibited a consistent positive correlation with the green energy-related metals market at medium to short-term frequencies, whereas green bonds showed a negative correlation with metals market at short-term frequencies and a positive correlation at long-term frequencies. © 2024 The Authors","Cryptocurrency; Green Bond; Green energy-related metals; Quantile; Return Connectedness; Wavelet Coherence","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (23&ZD175); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72173096, 72303139, 71873103)","This paper was supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 23&ZD175), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72173096, 72303139, 71873103).

Moreover, studies during COVID-19 pandemic generally do not report on representative/weighted non-probability samples. The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH-FIT) is a multi-country/multi-language survey conducting multivariable/LASSO-regularized regression models and network analyses to identify modifiable/non-modifiable factors associated with wellbeing (WHO-5)/composite psychopathology (P-score) change. It enrolled general population-representative/weighted-non-probability samples (26/04/2020-19/06/2022). Participants included 121,066 adults (age=42±15.9 years, females=64 %, representative sample=29 %) WHO-5/P-score worsened (SMD=0.53/SMD=0.74), especially initially during the pandemic. We identified 15 modifiable/nine non-modifiable risk and 13 modifiable/three non-modifiable protective factors for WHO-5, 16 modifiable/11 non-modifiable risk and 10 modifiable/six non-modifiable protective factors for P-score. The 12 shared risk/protective factors with highest centrality (network-analysis) were, for non-modifiable factors, country income, ethnicity, age, gender, education, mental disorder history, COVID-19-related restrictions, urbanicity, physical disorder history, household room numbers and green space, and socioeconomic status. For modifiable factors, we identified medications, learning, internet, pet-ownership, working and religion as coping strategies, plus pre-pandemic levels of stress, fear, TV, social media or reading time, and COVID-19 information. In multivariable models, for WHO-5, additional non-modifiable factors with |B|>1 were income loss, COVID-19 deaths. For modifiable factors we identified pre-pandemic levels of social functioning, hobbies, frustration and loneliness, and social interactions as coping strategy. For P-scores, additional non-modifiable/modifiable factors were income loss, pre-pandemic infection fear, and social interactions as coping strategy. COH-FIT identified vulnerable sub-populations and actionable individual/environmental factors to protect well-being/mental health during crisis times. Results inform public health policies, and clinical practice. © 2024","COH-FIT; Covid-19; P-factor; Psychiatry; Survey; Well-being","adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; calibration; Collaborative Outcomes Study on Health and Functioning During Infection Times; concentration loss; coping; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; educational status; environmental factor; ethnicity; fear; female; groups by age; health survey; human; income; Internet; learning; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; leisure; loneliness; low income country; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental disease; mental health; mental stress; multivariate logistic regression analysis; network analysis; occupation; outlier detection; pandemic; pet animal; physiological stress; posttraumatic stress disorder; probability sample; psychological well-being; psychosis; reading; religion; sleep disorder; social interaction; social media; socioeconomics; television viewing; tertiary education; transgender and gender nonbinary; urbanization; visual analog scale; WHO-5 Well-Being Index","","","","","","","Ahmed N., Barnett P., Greenburgh A., Pemovska T., Stefanidou T., Lyons N., Ikhtabi S., Talwar S., Francis E.R., Harris S.M., Shah P., Machin K., Jeffreys S., Mitchell L., Lynch C., Foye U., Schlief M., Appleton R., Saunders K.R.K., Baldwin H., Allan S.M., Sheridan-Rains L., Kharboutly O., Kular A., Goldblatt P., Stewart R., Kirkbride J.B., Lloyd-Evans B., Johnson S., Mental health in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review, Lancet Psychiatry, 10, pp. 537-556, (2023); Ahrens K.F., Neumann R.J., Kollmann B., Plichta M.M., Lieb K., Tuscher O., Reif A., Differential impact of COVID-related lockdown on mental health in Germany, World Psychiatry, 20, pp. 140-141, (2021); Charles B., Population pharmacokinetics: an overview, Aust.

This study aims to apply a cultural-resource based theory of the customer and show that retailers need to think more broadly about the value they create for consumers and the meaning they engage in their interactions with consumers. We performed in-depth interviews with Lebanese consumers to understand whether and to what degree COVID-19, economic, and political crises have altered their food purchasing habits and perceptions, and the implications for the developing country context of supermarketization and retail modernization. Findings reveal that multiple factors influence the choice of food shopping destination ranging from those identified in mainstream retail theories (price, product assortment) to the individual-level activation of meaning and identity creation consistent with the cultural resource-based theory of the customer. Recent shifts in retail patronage patterns are linked to specific crisis impacts but do not uniformly favor modern or traditional retailers, suggesting ambiguous impacts on retailers’ resilience and the future trajectory of supermarketization in Lebanon. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Crisis; Cultural-resource based theory of the customer; Emerging country; Food retail; Resilience; Supermarketization","Lebanon; consumption behavior; COVID-19; cultural relations; modernization; perception; retailing; supermarket","","","","","","","Askegaard S., Linnet J.T., Towards an epistemology of consumer culture theory: phenomenology and the context of context, Market.

The model considers two doses of vaccination, confinement, and treatment with limited resources. The control reproduction number is computed and the asymptotic stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium is proved. We also prove the existence of at least one endemic equilibrium whenever Rc > 1. Using real data from Germany, we calibrate our models by performing parameter estimations. We find that the control reproduction number is approximately equal to 1.90, which implies that the disease remains endemic in Germany. We also perform global sensitivity analysis by computing partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) between Rc (respectively compartments of infected individuals) and each model parameter. By fixing vaccine coverage at 70%, we observe that it might be more effective to increase the vaccine efficacy than increasing the numbers of vaccinated people. After that, we formulate the corresponding fractional model in the Caputo sense, proving positivity, boundedness, existence, and uniqueness of solutions. We calculate the control reproduction number of the fractional model, and prove the asymptotic stability of the DFE, and existence of at least one endemic equilibrium point. We find from numerical simulations, that for a long-term forecasting, it seems better to use a fractional derivative in the range φ ∈ (0, 0.87] than using just ordinary derivatives.

The focus here is the increasing digitalisation we are confronted with in many areas of our lives. The use of websites, social media, apps and other digital tools is widespread now across the globe and had already become a permanent feature of ECEC services before the COVID-19 pandemic started early in 2020 (Stratigos & Fenech, 2021). Two different types of digitalisation can be distinguished: the digitalisation of the communication between educators and parents, and the digitalisation of education itself, which became prevalent during lockdowns and restricted access to nurseries and schools. Using emails, WhatsApp groups or Facebook pages to stay in touch with parents has been a core part of the practitioner role. However, these are not always effective avenues to engage parents in their children’s learning and to involve parents in the nursery community. Erdreich (2021) points out that practitioners and teachers often shape digital communication with parents and, therefore, are able to control and restrict the interactions. The inherent power imbalance can reduce parents to passive recipients of information rather than as active participants in a dialogue between setting and home. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Ute Ward; individual chapters, the contributors.

Objective: This study aimed to explore perceived stress and contributing factors among expectant mothers with high-risk pregnancies. Methods: In 2022, a descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 150 high-risk pregnant mothers in comprehensive health centers in Hamadan, Iran. Convenience sampling was used to select participants. The study involved pregnant women between 24-36 weeks of gestation. The participants completed the demographic questionnaire and Cohen's perceived stress scale in a self-reported and written form. The cut point of 21.8 indicated a high stress level. Univariate and multivariate regression were used to determine the relationship between demographic-obstetric variables and perceived stress levels. Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata-13 software. A significance level of 0.05 was utilized in the analysis. Results: The mean stress score was 33.32 (9.51). Maternal perceived stress was higher with longer gestational age, history of COVID-19 infection, or renting a house, increasing the stress score by 0.85, 7.68, and 6.54, respectively. Conclusion: The study findings indicated that mothers with high-risk pregnancies experience high levels of perceived stress, which intensifies as their gestational age progresses or if they contract COVID-19 or have unstable housing. The results of this study can help policymakers, planners, and healthcare providers, such as midwives and nurses, in creating and implementing programs to decrease stress and its adverse effects in women with high-risk pregnancies. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.","COVID-19; gestational age; high-risk pregnancy; Perceived stress; pregnant mother; risk factors","adult; Article; cross-sectional study; expectant mother; female; gestational age; high risk pregnancy; hospitalization; household income; human; Iran; Likert scale; major clinical study; midwife; Perceived Stress Scale; physiological stress; pregnant woman; questionnaire; risk factor","","","","","Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, (14000630299)","This work was supported by Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Iran (Grant number: 14000630299).","Badakhsh M., Hastings-Tolsma M., Firouzkohi M., Amirshahi M., Hashemi Z.S., The lived experience of women with a highrisk pregnancy: A phenomenology investigation, Midwifery, (2020); Holness N., High-risk pregnancy, Nurs.

The epidemiological studies on antiviral innate immunity have mainly included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Importantly, this chapter will discuss how to use these methodologies to answer an epidemiological question of natural immunity in the viral infection process based on previous studies. An observational case- or cohort-based study of antiviral innate immunity may support this theoretical hypothesis but is not appropriate for clinical practice or treatment. RCTs are the gold standard for epidemiological studies and occupy a greater role in the hierarchy of evidence. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.","Antiviral innate immunity; COVID-19; Epidemiological study; Observational study; Randomized controlled trial","Antiviral Agents; COVID-19; Epidemiologic Studies; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Observational Studies as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; SARS-CoV-2; antivirus agent; antiviral innate immunity; clinical practice; epidemiological data; human; innate immunity; randomized controlled trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; immunology; observational study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology","","Antiviral Agents, ","","","","","Liu Y., Qin Y., Yang B., Et al., Pseudorabies virus usurps non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA to dampen viral DNA recognition by cGAS for antagonism of host antiviral innate immunity, J Virol, e0048324, (2024); Sun X., Liu T., Zhao J., Et al., DNA-PK deficiency potentiates cGAS-mediated antiviral innate immunity, Nat Commun, 11, 1, (2020); Rohrig B., du Prel J.B., Wachtlin D., Et al., Types of study in medical research: Part 3 of a series on evaluation of scientific publications, Deutsches Arzteblatt International, 106, 15, pp. 262-268, (2009); Guralnik J.M., Manolio T.A., Chapter 16—design and conduct of observational studies and clinical trials, Principles and Practice of Clinical Research, pp. 197-217, (2007); Wang X., Kattan M.W., Cohort studies: Design, analysis, and reporting, Chest 158(Suppl 1):S72–SS8, (2020); Cowan J., Amson A., Christofides A., Et al., Monoclonal antibodies as COVID-19 prophylaxis therapy in immunocompromised patient populations, Int J Infect Dis, 134, pp. 228-238, (2023); Zur M., Peselev T., Yanko S., Et al., Efficacy and safety of antiviral treatments for symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients: Systematic review and network meta-analysis, Antivir Res, 221, (2024); Calderon-Parra J., Gutierrez-Villanueva A., Ronda-Roca G., Et al., Efficacy and safety of antiviral plus anti-spike monoclonal antibody combination therapy vs. iontotherapy for high-risk immunocompromised patients with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV2 infection during the omicron era: A prospective cohort study, Int J Antimicrob Agents, 63, 3, (2024); Martinez-Portilla R.J., Sotiriadis A., Chatzakis C., Et al., Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection are at higher risk of death and pneumonia: A propensity score-matched analysis of a nationwide prospective cohort (COV19Mx), Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 57, 2, pp. 224-231, (2021); Coler B., Wu T.-Y., Carlson L., Et al., Diminished antiviral innate immune gene expression in the placenta following a maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 228, 4, (2023); Liang W., Li X., Wang H., Et al., Exploration of the common gene and potential molecular mechanisms between Herpes simplex virus 1 infection and Alzheimer’s disease, Genes Dis, 10, 3, pp. 746-749, (2023); Conde-Glez C., Lazcano-Ponce E., Rojas R., Et al., Seroprevalences of varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus in a cross-sectional study in Mexico, Vaccine, 31, 44, pp. 5067-5074, (2013); Mann C.J., Observational research methods.

One approach was for PSTs to teach each other, video-record their teaching, and code types of questions asked by the teachers. For a mathematics practicum, PSTs coded questions in two broad categories with four question types: lower-order questions that elicited (a) yes/no response or (b) one-word/short-answer responses; and higher-order questions that prompted students to (c) explain a mathematical concept or their chosen strategy and (d) give reasons for their strategy choice. This mixed-methods study examined data from PSTs’ coding of their peers’ questions posed during fourth-grade mathematics lessons, comparing it with the teacher educator’s coding of the same questions. In addition, PSTs’ lesson reflections served as a data source for triangulation as well as a means to analyze PSTs’ learning from this task. The results indicated that PSTs coded questions more often as higher order than the teacher educator. The findings also revealed the PSTs’ tendency to ask lower-order questions to gather recall or procedural information from students more than higher-order questions that probed students for an explanation or justification of their chosen strategies to solve a problem. Furthermore, the PSTs’ reflections on the coding task showed that PSTs were not only surprised that so many posed questions were lower-order, but also felt that coding questions increased their awareness of question quality. Recommendations suggest approaches that can be incorporated into teacher education programs to develop PSTs’ questioning skills. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

Aim: To explore the factors that foster resilience among final-year nursing students that joined the healthcare workforce during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Descriptive qualitative study with thematic analysis. Participants: Newly graduated nurses who had volunteered to join the health workforce during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic as final-year bachelor of nursing students. Methods: Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted during January and February 2021. Interviews were conducted by nursing students as part of their final-year dissertation with the supervision of a researcher with experience on qualitative data collection methods. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was performed using Weft QDA 1.0.1. Results: The analysis revealed two main themes that described newly graduated nurses views regarding the factors that had enabled them to develop resilience when working on the frontline as final-year nursing students: (1) factors that helped them cope with adversity related with the identification and use of personal resources, feeling supported from others and professional recognition; and (2) factors that promoted learning such as guided reflection and the opportunity to share peer experiences. Conclusion: The identification and use of personal resources, recognition and support from others, guided reflection and sharing peer experiences appear to be the key factors in helping nursing students develop resilience in the face of challenging situations. Promoting these factors in the context of nurse education programmes will help to ensure that future professionals are better prepared to deal with the challenges that nurses face in clinical practice in their early career. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Early career nurse; Nursing students; Pandemic; Professional growth; Qualitative study; Resilience","","","","","","Official College of Nurses of Barcelona, (PR480/2021)","This study had been funded partially by the Official College of Nurses of Barcelona (www.coib.cat) as part of the Nurse Research Projects Grants (PR480/2021).","Abd Elmenem Ibrahim A., Fathi Sleem W., Relationship between reality shock and career resilience among nursing intern's students, Egyptian J.

Objectives: Given that various strains of COVID-19 impact food security differently, we assessed the food security status of households in Semnan province, Iran, during and after the containment of the omicron variant. Methods: Data from 231 households were gathered using a standard questionnaire that evaluated socioeconomic characteristics, food security based on the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module, and vulnerability to food insecurity. A quantitative model was utilized to identify factors associated with food insecurity during and post-pandemic. Results: The findings indicated an improvement in household food security following the management of COVID-19, with significant differences observed in food security levels, especially concerning severe food insecurity, during versus after the COVID-19 period. The quantitative model analysis revealed that, with the exception of the head of household's occupation status, personal savings, and the number of educated and employed members within a household, all variables significantly correlated with food security (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These outcomes highlight how the relationship between socioeconomic factors and food security levels may vary depending on the pandemic's timing, environmental conditions, and household resilience, underlining the importance of adaptive policymaking that responds to current circumstances and the evolving links between socioeconomic determinants and food security. © 2024, Sadeghi et al.","Coronavirus Disease 2019;

The findings indicate that three paths are particularly significant: system enjoyment (SE) influences effort expectancy (EE), performance expectancy (PE) affects behavioral intention (BI), and facilitating conditions (FC) impact behavioral intention (BI). The UTAUT model provides a nuanced understanding of students’ acceptance of technology, particularly within the context of online education. It serves as an effective tool to measure the impact and acceptance of technology. The complex nature of the online learning environment necessitates an investigation into the critical latent factors that influence students' use of the system. This study, employing an extended UTAUT model, offers valuable insights into online education during the pandemic. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

However, insufficient compound or molecular graphs and feature representations might significantly impair and jeopardize their full potential. Despite the devastating impacts of ongoing COVID-19 across the globe, for which there is no drug with proven efficacy that has been shown to be effective. As various stages of drug discovery and repositioning require the accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI), here, we propose a relational graph convolution network (RGCN) using multi-features based on the developed drug compound-coronavirus target graph data representation and combination of features. During the implementation of the model, we further introduced the use of not only the feature module to understand the topological structure of drugs but also the structure of the proven drug target (i.e., 3CLpro) for SARS-CoV-2 that shares a genome sequence similar to that of other members of the betacoronavirus group such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, bat coronavirus. Our feature comprises topological information in molecular SMILES and local chemical context in the SMILES sequence for the drug compound and drug target. Our proposed method prevailed with high and compelling performance accuracy of 97.30% which could be prioritized as the potential and promising prediction route for the development of novel oral antiviral medicine for COVID-19 drugs. Objective: Forecasting DTI stands as a pivotal aspect of drug discovery. The focus on computational methods in DTI prediction has intensified due to the considerable expense and time investment associated with conducting extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments. Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly deep learning, have found broad applications in DTI prediction. We are convinced that this study could be prioritized and utilized as the promising predictive route for the development of novel oral antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and other variants of coronaviruses. Methods: This study addressed the problem of COVID-19 drugs using proposed RGCN with multi-features as an attractive and potential route. This study focused mainly on the prediction of novel antiviral drugs against coronaviruses using graph-based methodology, namely RGCN. This research further utilized the features of both drugs and common potential drug targets found in betacorona-viruses group to deepen understanding of their underlying relation. Results: Our suggested approach prevailed with a high and convincing performance accuracy of 97.30%, which may be utilized as a top priority to support and advance this field in the prediction and development of novel antiviral treatments against coronaviruses and their variants. Conclusion: We recursively performed experiments using the proposed method on our constructed DCC-CvT graph dataset from our collected dataset with various single and multiple combinations of features and found that our model had achieved comparable best-averaged accuracy performance on T7 features followed by a combination of T7, R6, and L8. The proposed model implemented in this investigation turns out to outperform the previous related works. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.","3CL<sup>pro</sup> drug target; Coronavirus; COVID-19; deep learning; drug discovery and development; graph neural network; machine learning; SARS-CoV-2","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Coronavirus; Deep learning; Graph neural networks; anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; coronavirus 3C protease; 3CLpro drug target; Coronaviruses; Deep learning; Drug development; Drug discovery; Drug targets; Drug-target interactions; Graph neural networks; Machine-learning; Relational graph; Article; Betacoronavirus; drug targeting; feature extraction; gene sequence; machine learning; metric system; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; prediction; relational graph convolution network; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; validation process; virus strain; COVID-19","","3C viral protease, ; coronavirus 3C protease, ","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (RS-2023-00252745); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Ministry of Education, MOE, (2020R1A6A1A12047945); Ministry of Education, MOE","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (Grant No. RS-2023-00252745).

The article not only examines the model’s behavior but also rigorously establishes the existence and uniqueness of solutions for this complex piecewise system. To tackle the numerical approximation of solutions, the study employs Newton’s polynomial interpolation scheme, shedding light on the model’s behavior under different conditions. Through meticulous graphical representations, the article effectively communicates the results and numerical solutions across various classes of the model, each defined by distinct fractional orders. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the pandemic’s multifaceted dynamics, serving as a basis for understanding its progression and evaluating potential control strategies. © 2025 All rights reserved.","COVID-19; existence and uniqueness; fractional operator; numerical simulations; stability analysis","","","","","","Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, PSAU, (PSAU/2023/01/24687)","The authors extend their appreciation to Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University for funding this research work through the project number (PSAU/2023/01/24687).","Abro K.

Many traditional nucleic acid-related sensing strategies have been employed in analytical chemistry, including fluorescence, colorimetric and chemiluminescence methods. However, their key limitation is the lack of understanding of the interaction during analysis, particularly at the 3D matrix level close to biological tissue. To address this issue, smart-responsive hydrogels are increasingly used in biosensing due to their hydrophilic and biocompatible properties. By combining smart-responsive hydrogels with traditional nucleic acid-related sensing, biological microenvironments can be mimicked, and targets can be easily accessed and diffused, making them ideal for nucleic acid sensing. This review focuses on utilizing smart-responsive hydrogels for nucleic acid-related sensing and detection, including nucleic acid detection, other nucleic acid-based analyte detection and nucleic acid-related sensing platforms applying nucleic acid as sensing tools in hydrogels. Additionally, the analytical mechanisms of smart-responsive hydrogels with the combination of various detection platforms such as optical and electrochemical techniques are described. The limitations of using smart-responsive hydrogels in nucleic acid-related sensing and proposed possible solutions are also discussed. Lastly, the future challenge of smart-responsive hydrogels in nucleic acid-related sensing is explored. Smart-responsive hydrogels can be used as biomimetic materials to simulate the extracellular matrix, achieve biosensing, and exhibit great potential in nucleic acid-related sensing. They serve as a valuable complement to traditional detection and analytical methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrogels; Nucleic acid-related sensing; Nucleic acids; Sensors; Smart-responsive","biomimetic material; hydrogel; nucleic acid; Biological tissues; Biosensing; Clinical diagnostics; Genotyping; Human Genome Project; Hydrophilics; matrix; Nucleic acid-related sensing; Responsive hydrogels; Smart-responsive; analytic method; chemoluminescence; coronavirus disease 2019; electrochemical analysis; extracellular matrix; fluorescence; genotype; genotyping; human; microenvironment; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; review; sensor; simulation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22204064, 22276080); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20220645, BK20211340); Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX23_3899); Graduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX24_4163)","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 22204064 and 22276080), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (Nos.

The considered model includes a general fractional derivative incorporating well-known types, specifically Caputo-Fabrizio, Atangana-Baleanu and Weighted Atangana-Baleanu. Our theoretical results are two-fold. First, under suitable assumptions, the existence of a solution for the considered system is proven. Moreover, the local stability of the free-disease and endemic equilibrium points is addressed in terms of R0. Secondly, a particular example is considered where the fractional derivative has two varying parameters, and an approach allowing for their estimation is proposed, with the aim of providing the best approximation of the real COVID-19 dynamics. The main novelty of our proposed approach is its use of physics-informed-neural-networks (PINNs) for estimating the fractional orders. On the other hand, to validate our results, a numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the local stability of the disease dynamics, as well as the effectiveness of our proposed method in providing the best approximation of the two fractional derivative parameters. © 2025 All rights reserved.","Epidemic model; equilibrium points; incidence rate; numerical analysis; optimal control","","","","","","","","Ain Q.

Previous studies on multi-task structures have been limited in providing detailed insights into their architectures. Addressing these details is crucial for enhancing the performance of multi-task structures. Our proposed multi-task structure, based on the U-Net architecture, incorporates a shared encoder, a specialized segmentation decoder, and a multi-layer perceptron for classification. In the proposed approach, image processing algorithms, including histogram equalization, median filtering, and morphological operations have been employed in the pre-processing stage of input images. Also, by combining these algorithms in pairs, an attempt has been made to enhance the performance of tasks. Initial preprocessing and the integration of the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) contribute to effective feature extraction. Post-processing with Conditional Random Field (CRF) further refines segmentation outputs. CRF considers spatial dependencies within the segmentation results, contributing to more precise delineation of COVID-19-affected areas in CT scans. Evaluation on using dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of pairwise combinations of image processing algorithms, achieving superior results with a segmentation accuracy of 95.66 % and a classification accuracy of 95.62 %. The incorporation of the CBAM module improves classification accuracy to 96.22 %. Moreover, Integrating CBAM and CRF significantly improves segmentation accuracy to 96.51 %. The application of our proposed method steps to U-Net++ and ResUnet showcases their potential for enhancing multi-task structures. This study establishes new COVID-19 detection standards, promising progress in medical image analysis. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Chest CT scans; Deep multi-task learning model; Shared representations","Image segmentation; Lung cancer; Median filters; Chest CT scans; CT-scan; Deep multi-task learning model; Learning models; Multi tasks; Multitask learning; Performance; Random fields; Shared representations; Task structure; adult; algorithm; Article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; feature extraction; filtration; histogram; human; image analysis; imaging algorithm; learning; major clinical study; multilayer perceptron; spatial analysis; COVID-19","","","","","","","Zhu N., Zhang D., Wang W., Li X., Yang B., Song J., Zhao X., Huang B., Shi W., Lu R., Et al., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in china, 2019, N.

During the COVID - 19 pandemic and limitations of face-to-face education, the use of distance education can play an important role in providing education to patients. The aim of this study is the effect of model 5A self-management training on medication adherence in epileptic patients. METHODS: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 56 epileptic patients referred to Shiraz Namazi Hospital were divided into intervention and control groups using random allocation. Thereafter, 5A self - management training sessions were virtually held in 5 sessions in WhatsApp application for intervention group. The data collection tool was MMAS-8 at two stages of before and two months after intervention. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 21 software. RESULTS: The results of Wilcoxon test showed that in intervention group, the mean drug adherence in patients after intervention significantly increased compared to before intervention (p = 0.005). But in control group, this was not significant (p = 0.909). According to results of Mann-Whitney test, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups before intervention (p = 0.632). However, by passing two months from intervention, a significant difference was found between intervention and control groups (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Based on results, the implementation of model 5A can be effective on medication adherence in epileptic patients. This program can be considered as a suitable method in epileptic patients during COVID - 19 pandemic.","COVID - 19 pandemic; Education; epileptic patients Model 5A.; Medication Adherence; Self-management","COVID-19; Epilepsy; Humans; Medication Adherence; Pandemics; Self-Management; Single-Blind Method; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; epilepsy; human; medication compliance; pandemic; procedures; randomized controlled trial; self care; single blind procedure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1028768X","","","37994005","English","Acta Neurol Taiwan","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177975564"

Adsorption has long been regarded as one of the most promising methods to remove pollutants from wastewater. Among various adsorbent materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of porous materials, are considered as an excellent adsorbent due to its high specific surface area, high porosity, high crystallinity, tunable pore size and structure, and abundant active sites. In this review, we analyze the influences of different preparation and modification methods on the structure of MOFs and the improvement of adsorption properties of MOFs and its derivatives. In addition, we focus on the emerging contaminants that pose a great threat to human life and health, and further analyze the adsorption mechanism and the factors that affect the adsorption performance. This review emphasizes the application value of the materials, summarizes the challenges faced by the application of MOFs in adsorbing emerging contaminants, and provides insights for future large-scale applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; COVID-19 related drugs; Emerging contaminants (ECs); Metal organic frameworks (MOFs); Radioactive pollutant","Adsorption; Contamination; Crystallinity; Ecosystems; Groundwater pollution; Health risks; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Pore size; Porous materials; River pollution; COVID-19 related drug; Emerging contaminant; Food chain; Human health; Metal organic framework; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Radioactive pollutants; Recent progress; Rivers and lakes; COVID-19","","","","","Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China; National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, (202310288025); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program, (BE2021720, BE2023820); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51778281); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, (PCRRF19032); State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse","The National Natural Science Foundation of China (51778281), the Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program (BE2023820, BE2021720), Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China, State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse Foundation (PCRRF19032) and National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Item number: 202310288025) are greatly acknowledged.","Cavanagh J.-A.-E., Trought K., Mitchell C., Northcott G., Tremblay L.A., Assessment of endocrine disruption and oxidative potential of bisphenol-A, triclosan, nonylphenol, diethylhexyl phthalate, galaxolide, and carbamazepine, common contaminants of municipal biosolids, Toxicol. in Vitro, 48, pp. 342-349, (2018); Barrick A., Champeau O., Butler J., Wiles T., Boundy M., Tremblay L.A., Investigating the Ecotoxicity of Select Emerging Organic Contaminants Toward the Marine Copepod Gladioferens pectinatus, Environ.

The present study examines the issues encountered by higher education instructors in the virtual learning environment implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a case study using qualitative research, an approach method was conducted during the spring 2021 to 2022 semester: a study group comprised of five instructional members from three institutions in the Midwestern region of the United States. A digital online interview form was shared with the participants to guide the interviews. The obtained data was analyzed through the content analysis method with the primary intent of making two contributions to the literature. First, it illuminates the challenges associated with virtual learning and the availability/unavailability of student support services. Second, it offers insights into the roles and relative influences of faculty collaboration and student controllability as the antecedents of continued student learning and support systems. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

Accordingly, recent optimization literature described the problem of optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens, modeled as a multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows and a completion time objective function. Aiming to achieve good-quality solutions in short computational times, this work describes a hybrid approach, combining a matheuristic construction phase with an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). Our matheuristic relies on a clustering algorithm to yield subsets of the medical specimens that are optimally served by single vehicles of the fleet. The solutions of the matheuristic phase serve as starting points for the ALNS intensification phase. Extensive experimentation on both new and established benchmark problem instances shows that our hybrid method is able to match the optimality of the state of the art on small instances and outperforms the existing exact method by one order of magnitude on larger problems. © 2023 The Authors.

Research is needed to better understand barriers and motivators to vaccine uptake. The current investigation employed a series of focus groups, framed through the theory of planned behavior, among young people in North Macedonia. The discussions revealed three key themes related to individuals’ attitudes, perceptions of subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control. Among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, influenced by the collectivist culture, attitudes toward vaccination were tied to concerns about family members. Additionally, once again guided by the collectivist culture, individuals were strongly influenced by the vaccination norms established in their social networks. Finally, participants shared that the vaccine was widely available, and thus perceived behavioral control (i.e., access) did not represent a barrier to vaccine uptake. This insight creates a foundation of knowledge upon which interventions can be developed. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

To describe the spread of this infectious disease, we propose a mathematical model including some important aspects, such as the carrier and memory effects as well as the nonlinearity of incidence function. The memory effect is described by the Hattaf fractal-fractional derivative. Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are established by means of Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem and Banach contraction. Furthermore, our results show that the proposed fractal-fractional model has one stable disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number satisfiesR0 ≤ 1 and a unique stable endemic equilibrium when R0 > 1. In addition, numerical simulations for different values of fractal and fractional orders are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results. © 2025, International Scientific Research Publications.

Bacteriophage φ6 survival on contaminated gloves was assessed over 9 days at 25 °C. The effectiveness of photodynamic treatment using curcumin as a photosensitizer to inactivate φ6 on fruits was determined. The fruit type and the glove material influenced the φ6 transfer. Longer contact times resulted in greater φ6 transfer. The highest φ6 transfer occurred from tomato to HDPE glove (0.8% or −1.1 log % transfer) after 30 s of contact at the higher inoculum level. Bacteriophage φ6 was detected on cross-contaminated HDPE gloves for up to 6 days. Bacteriophage φ6 survived better on vinyl gloves cross-contaminated by cucumber vs. tomato (detected up to 6 vs 3 days). Photodynamic inactivation of φ6 was time-dependent and varied with the tested fruit but was not influenced by viral starting concentration. Photodynamic treatment decreased the φ6 titer by 3.0 and 2.2 log PFU/sample in tomato and cucumber, respectively. Transmission electronic microscopy showed that photodynamic treatment changed the structure of the φ6 capsid. These findings may help in the management of SARS-CoV-2 contamination risks in fruit handling. They may also help in the establishment of effective measures to manage cross-contamination risk. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Foodborne viruses; Fresh produce; Gloves; Photodynamic inactivation","","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (303384/2022-0, 311863/2022-1, 402745/2021-3); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (88881.311776/2018-01)","Authors would like to thank the \u201CConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00EDfico e Tecnol\u00F3gico\u201D (CNPq; Grants # 303384/2022-0, #311863/2022-1, # 402745/2021-3) and \u201CCoordena\u00E7\u00E3o de Aconselhamento de Pessoal de N\u00EDvel Superior\u201D (CAPES-Brazil; Finance Code 001; UFPB PrInt 88881.311776/2018-01).

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of psychological distress among Australian adults aged 18–64 years and identify sociodemographic factors associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted using data from the National Health Survey 2020–21 to calculate weighted national estimates of the prevalence of psychological distress using the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10). The association between sociodemographic factors and psychological distress was analysed using multivariable logistic regression, with adjustments for complex survey design. Results: The average of K10 score was 16.94, with a prevalence of combined high/very high distress reported at 21.13 % among Australian adults. Young women aged 18–25 reported the highest average scores (M = 20.44) across all sex and age groups. Risk factors associated with psychological distress included lower personal income, marital status (never married; widowed/divorced/separated) and being ‘born in Australia’. Protective factors included homeownership and having children in the household. Additionally, among women, being aged ≥56 was significantly associated with lower odds of psychological distress. Limitations: Data collection relied on self-completed online form, and a cross-sectional design limits the inference of a causal relationship. Discussion: During COVID-19 pandemic, lower personal income and being female have consistently been identified as risk factors for psychological distress. Targeted and tailored interventions based on age, sex and disadvantage are warranted, particularly focusing on younger women, to alleviate the adverse effect of the pandemic on the population's mental health. © 2024 The Authors","Adults; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress; Sociodemographic","adult; Article; Australian; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; distress syndrome; face-to-face interview; female; follow up; health status; health survey; human; Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10); major clinical study; male; personal income; prevalence; public health; risk factor; secondary analysis; sex difference; sociodemographics","","","","","Australian Bureau of Statistics","The authors express their gratitude to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for providing access to the National Health Survey dataset.","Abegglen S., Greif R., Fuchs A., Berger-Estilita J., COVID-19-related trajectories of psychological health of acute care healthcare professionals: a 12-month longitudinal observational study, Front.

Short and long-term debt instruments are studied through a quantitative study of correlational scope. We observe that during the pandemic period, the issuance volumes of all instruments except for financial trusts and endorsed post-dated checks decrease. The issuance periods show dissimilar behavior. A changing behavior of the cost differential of financial instruments compared to the advance in the current account is observed. However, when considering the cost of financing in real terms in the capital markets, there are no significant differences between the pandemic period and the previous and subsequent periods. © 2025 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Study design: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study that included all patients aged <18 years with laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as registered in official Brazilian national surveillance systems for COVID-19 between February 2020 and February 2023. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related deaths. Odds ratios (ORs) of risk factors associated with death were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Over a 3-year period, 2 855 704 pediatric patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were registered in Brazil. Of these, 59 179 (2.1%) were hospitalized, 13 844 (0.48%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 4943 (0.17%) received mechanical ventilation. A total of 4740 (0.17%) patients had fatal outcomes. The case fatality rate increased to 7.9% among patients who required hospitalization; 2102 (44.3%) patients who died did not receive advanced critical support. Notably, 2 (65%, 95% CI 58-71) or 3 doses (86%, 95% CI 81-89) of the vaccine provided strong protection against death. The following adjusted covariates were significantly associated with increased odds of death: age (0-4 and 11-17 years), ethnicity (Brown and Indigenous), region (Northeast or North), dyspnea, nosocomial infection, and comorbidities. Conversely, living in the South or Central-West regions, admission in the later period of the pandemic, and receiving a vaccine were all associated with protection against death. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a complex interplay between individual factors and social inequities has shaped the impact of COVID-19 on Brazilian children and adolescents. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","children; COVID-19; death; ethnicity; risk factors; vaccine","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adolescent; Article; artificial ventilation; assisted ventilation; Brazilian; case fatality rate; child; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; demographics; dyspnea; epidemic curve; fatality; female; hospital infection; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; odds ratio; oxygen saturation; retrospective study; risk factor; social inequality","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG","This study was supported by the CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00EDfico e Tecnol\u00F3gico) and FAPEMIG (Funda\u00E7\u00E3o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais).

Non-probability samples are increasingly used for their low research costs and the speed of the attainment of results, but these surveys are expected to have strong selection bias caused by several mechanisms that can eventually lead to unreliable estimates of the population parameters of interest. Thus, the classical methods of statistical inference do not apply because the probabilities of inclusion in the sample for individual members of the population are not known. Therefore, in the last few decades, new possibilities of inference from non-probability sources have appeared. Statistical theory offers different methods for addressing selection bias based on the availability of auxiliary information about other variables related to the main variable, which must have been measured in the non-probability sample. Two important approaches are inverse probability weighting and mass imputation. Other methods can be regarded as combinations of these two approaches. This study proposes a new estimation technique for non-probability samples. We call this technique model-assisted kernel weighting, which is combined with some machine learning techniques. The proposed technique is evaluated in a simulation study using data from a population and drawing samples using designs with varying levels of complexity for, a study on the relative bias and mean squared error in this estimator under certain conditions. After analyzing the results, we see that the proposed estimator has the smallest value of both the relative bias and the mean squared error when considering different sample sizes, and in general, the kernel weighting methods reduced more bias compared to based on inverse weighting. We also studied the behavior of the estimators using different techniques such us generalized linear regression versus machine learning algorithms, but we have not been able to find a method that is the best in all cases. Finally, we study the influence of the density function used, triangular or standard normal functions, and conclude that they work similarly. A case study involving a non-probability sample that took place during the COVID-19 lockdown was conducted to verify the real performance of the proposed methodology, obtain a better estimate, and control the value of the variance. © 2024 The Author(s)","Confinement period; COVID-19; Employment; Kernel weighting; Model-assisted kernel","Inverse problems; Auxiliary information; Classical methods; Confinement period; Kernel weighting; Mean squared error; Model-assisted kernel; Probability weighting; Selection bias; Statistical inference; Statistical theory; Mean square error","","","","","Consejería de Universidad, Investigación e Innovación; CBUA; European Commission, EC; Universidad de Granada, UGR; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER, (C-EXP-153-UGR23); IMAG-María de Maeztu, (PPJIA2023-030, CEX2020-001105-M/AEI/10.13039/501100011033)","Funding text 1: This work is part of grant PDC2022-133293-I00 funded by the MCIN/AEI/10.13039/5011000 11033 and the European Union \u201CNextGenerationEU\u201D/PRTR\u201D1 and the grant FEDER C-EXP-153-UGR23 funded by the Consejer\u00EDa de Universidad, Investigaci\u00F3n e Innovaci\u00F3n and by the ERDF Andalusia Program 2021\u20132027 .

Hence, real-time crowding information (RTCI) might have become even more instrumental in supporting travel decisions in congested urban PT systems. This study investigates the willingness to wait (WTW) to reduce (or avoid) overcrowding with RTCI in urban PT (bus and tram) journeys, analysing pre- vs. post-COVID travel behaviour attitudes. Stated-preference data and (subsequently estimated) choice models indicate that, while the pre-COVID WTW was primarily driven by mere possibility to avoid an overcrowded first departure, the post-COVID propensity to wait is strongly associated with expectations of seat availability in second departure as well. The ex-post WTW with RTCI seems to have become less-dependent on individual characteristics and more prominent for time-critical (obligatory) trips as well. Our findings underpin the rising relevance of passenger overcrowding in urban PT journeys. Moreover, they help better understand the potential of RTCI in post-pandemic recovery of PT ridership. © 2024 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Discrete choice modelling; Passenger crowding; Public transport; Real-time crowding information; RTCI; Willingness to wait","","","","","","Politechnika Krakowska, CUT","Authors would like to express their gratitude to Prof. Achille Fonzone from Edinburgh Napier University for his crucial and valuable research support; and to Ms Urszula Kierpiec and Mr Dawid Dudek from Cracow University of Technology for their support in data collection process.","Aghabayk K., Esmailpour J., Shiwakoti N., Effects of COVID-19 on rail passengers’ crowding perceptions, Transp.

However, it remains unclear whether some employees fared worse than others when facing work-related health threats and what role individual differences in vulnerability to disease played in shaping their work experiences. Integrating the evolutionary psychology perspective of the behavioral immune system with Job Demands-Resources Theory, we argue that a fundamental factor in how employees dealt with these threats was the extent to which they perceived themselves as vulnerable to infectious diseases. Employees with higher susceptibility to infectious diseases were predicted to experience heightened workplace safety concerns and engage less with their work. In addition, a health-oriented leadership style was expected to decrease employees' safety concerns and increase their work engagement, especially for the more vulnerable employees. To test hypotheses, we conducted a three-wave field survey and two vignette-based experiments on working adults in the United Kingdom at different stages of the pandemic. Results largely supported our predictions, revealing that employees who felt more vulnerable to infectious diseases were more concerned about their workplace safety, inhibiting their work engagement. We discuss these findings' theoretical and practical implications for promoting a safe and healthy post-pandemic workplace, especially for vulnerable employees. © 2024 The Authors","Behavioral immune system; Health-oriented leadership; Job demands-resources theory; Perceived infectability; Work engagement; Workplace safety","","","","","","","","Ackerman J.M., Hill S.E., Murray D.R., The behavioral immune system: Current concerns and future directions, Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 12, 2, (2018); Aguinis H., Bradley K.J., Best practice recommendations for designing and implementing experimental vignette methodology studies, Organizational Research Methods, 17, 4, pp. 351-371, (2014); Bakker A.B., Demerouti E., ).

The aspect of ESG that enhances firm viability remains uncertain, as does whether this aspect varies across firms that exhibit distinct supply chain concentrations (SCCs). Clarifying these issues is essential for companies’ attempts to tailor their ESG portfolios in the context of operations to suit their unique circumstances and to improve supply chain viability. The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to examine these issues. Our study utilizes data regarding Chinese listed firms to conduct an empirical assessment of how ESG affects stock market performance in response to the increase in COVID-19 cases both within China (the national outbreak) and at the global level excluding China (the global pandemic). The results reveal that a significant decline in stock returns occurred as COVID-19 cases increased. Firms that exhibited higher levels of preexisting ESG performance were associated with a less pronounced decrease in stock returns during the national outbreak. Notably, environmental and social responsibilities emerged as key protective factors in response to the national COVID-19 outbreak, while corporate governance proved to be more effective with regard to addressing the global pandemic. In addition, our study reveals that the safeguard provided by environmental and social responsibilities functions as a form of insurance primarily among low-SCC firms. On the other hand, the protective effect of high corporate governance is more evident among high-SCC firms. These findings offer valuable insights for companies seeking to fine-tune their ESG portfolios and navigate the interactions between ESG and SCC. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; ESG; Market performance; Supply chain concentration; Viability","Chain concentration; Corporate governance; Empirical assessment; Environmental responsibility; Environmental, social and governance; Market performance; Social responsibilities; Stock returns; Supply chain concentration; Viability","","","","","","","Chung K., Nguyen L.T.M., Nguyen D.T.T., Improving hotels’ operational efficiency through ESG investment: A risk management perspective, Serv Sci, (2023); Cuervo-Cazurra A., Purkayastha S., Ramaswamy K., Variations in the corporate social responsibility-performance relationship in emerging market firms, Organ Sci, 34, 4, pp. 1626-1650, (2023); Fereydooni A., Barak S., Sajadi S.M.A., A novel online portfolio selection approach based on pattern matching and ESG factors, Omega, 123, (2024); Shan C., Tang D.Y., The value of employee satisfaction in disastrous times: Evidence from COVID-19, (2020); Ding W., Levine R.E., Lin C., Xie W., Corporate immunity to the COVID-19 pandemic, J Financ Econ, 141, 2, pp. 802-830, (2021); Hwang C.Y., Titman S., Wang Y., Investor tastes, corporate behavior, and stock returns: An analysis of corporate social responsibility, Manage Sci, 68, 10, pp. 7131-7152, (2022); Moss A., Naughton J.P., Wang C., The irrelevance of environmental, social, and governance disclosure to retail investors, Manage Sci, (2023); Hsu A.W.-H., Wang T., Does the market value corporate response to climate change?, Omega, 41, 2, pp. 195-206, (2013); Albuquerque R., Koskinen Y., Yang S., Zhang C., Resiliency of environmental and social stocks: An analysis of the exogenous COVID-19 market crash, Rev Corp Financ Stud, 9, 3, pp. 593-621, (2020); Li G., Li N., Sethi S.P., Does CSR reduce idiosyncratic risk?

The hypothesis is we are able to measure phenotypes that lie at the origin of ARDS severity and fibrosis development. The aim is an accuracy study of prognostic circulating biomarkers. Methods: A longitudinal study followed COVID-related ARDS patients with medical imaging, pulmonary function tests and biomarker analysis, generating 444 laboratory data. Comparison to controls used non-parametrical statistics; p < 0·05 was considered significant. Cut-offs were obtained through receiver operating curve. Contingency tables revealed predictive values. Odds ratio was calculated through logistic regression. Results: Angiotensin 1–7 beneath 138 pg/mL defined Angiotensin imbalance phenotype. Hyper-inflammatory phenotype showed a composite index test above 34, based on high Angiotensin 1–7, C-Reactive Protein, Ferritin and Transforming Growth Factor-β. Analytical study showed conformity to predefined goals. Clinical performance gave a positive predictive value of 95 % (95 % confidence interval, 82 %–99 %), and a negative predictive value of 100 % (95 % confidence interval, 65 %–100 %). Those severe ARDS phenotypes represented 34 (Odds 95 % confidence interval, 3–355) times higher risk for pulmonary fibrosis development (p < 0·001). Conclusions: Angiotensin 1–7 composite index is an early and objective predictor of ARDS evolving to pulmonary fibrosis. It may guide therapeutic decisions in targeted phenotypes. © 2024 The Authors","In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device; Interstitial Lung Diseases; Precision Medicine; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Respiratory Distress Syndrome","Aged; Angiotensin I; Biomarkers; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; alkaline phosphatase; biological marker; C reactive protein; carbon monoxide; ferritin; lactate dehydrogenase; talfirastide; transferrin; transforming growth factor beta; angiotensin I; angiotensin I (1-7); peptide fragment; adult; Article; computer assisted tomography; contingency table; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; enzyme immunoassay; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; human; hyperinflammation; hypertension; in vitro study; intensive care unit; interstitial lung disease; length of stay; longitudinal study; lung fibrosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; normal human; observational study; personalized medicine; prevalence; prospective study; real time polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; respiratory distress; respiratory distress syndrome; sensitivity and specificity; aged; blood; complication; diagnosis","","alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; ferritin, 9007-73-2; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A, ; talfirastide, 39386-80-6, 51833-78-4; transferrin, 82030-93-1; angiotensin I, 9041-90-1; Angiotensin I, ; angiotensin I (1-7), ; Biomarkers, ; Peptide Fragments, ","Lumipulse G1200, Fujirebio, Japan","Fujirebio, Japan","CHU Saint-Pierre; NDV; Philippe de Diesbach; Chung Hua University, CHU; Laboratoire Hospitalier Universitaire Bruxelles – Universitair Laboratorium Brussel, (CE/20-06-04, CE/2020/141)","We gratefully thank Philippe de Diesbach, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Pierard, Eldar Smajic and Marc Bertrand-Enche for their insights.

Under-resourced communities thus felt the brunt of the pandemic, having to find resourceful ways to combat vulnerabilities brought on by the crisis. The dire states in which such communities throughout the world found themselves inspired various acts of solidarity and support in the face of adversity. The primary aim of the study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of community solidarity and support during the COVID-19 pandemic of members of two under-resourced communities in South Africa. To obtain a comprehensive account of these perceptions and experiences, a qualitative community case study design was used, and thirty key informant interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted with multiple community stakeholders across the two communities. Participant responses were explored through two main themes, namely: (1) The brutal materialization of lockdown in communities and (2) Experiences of and contributions to community solidarity and support. This article attempts to emphasize the value of collective action during times of crisis and to encourage the promotion of sustainable community solidarity initiatives as a way to mitigate future crises. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

They enable to visualize charge distributions and charge related properties. MEP not only allows to visualize the size and shape but also provides an invaluable tool for predicting the behavior of complex molecules. Their profiles are particularly useful for medicinal and organic chemists. MEP being an experimentally determinable property contains a wealth of reliable information of intrinsic molecular and material interaction capabilities. It is therefore commonly known as “interaction pharmacophore”. The present chapter first introduces the theoretical foundation of MEP and its mathematical expressions followed by various earlier application studies. Finally, the chapter describes MEP applications in drug design and discovery studies ranging from mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, to cardiotonics, anti-inflammatory, malarial, leishmanial, insect repellency, organo-phosphorous poisoning and antiviral compounds including identification of potential anti Covid-19 compounds from author’s laboratory. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Drug discovery and virtual screening; Interaction pharmacophore models; Molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs) and profiles; Stereo-electronic properties","Drug interactions; Molecular docking; Drug discovery; Drug discovery and virtual screening; Interaction pharmacophore model; Molecular electrostatic potential  and profile; Molecular electrostatic potentials; Pharmacophore models; Pharmacophores; Property; Stereo-electronic property; Virtual Screening; Stereocenters","","","","","","","Topics in Current Chemistry, (1973); Naray-Szabo G., Ferenzy G.G., Molecular electrostatics, Chem Rev, 95, pp. 829-847, (1995); Karelson M., Lobanov V.S., Katritzky A.R., Quantum-chemical descriptors in QSAR/QSPR studies, Chem Rev, 96, pp. 1027-1044, (1996); Scrocco E., Tomasi J (1978) Advances in quantum chemistry, Vol II In, (1978); Naray-Szabo G., Analysis of molecular recognition: Steric, electrostatic and hydrophobic complementarity, J Mol Recognit, 6, pp. 205-210, (1993); Leach A.R., Gillet V.J., Lewis R.A., Taylor R., Three-dimensional pharmacophore methods in drug discovery, J Med Chem, pp. 539-558, (2010); Pharmacophore, Perception, Development, and Use in Drug Design.

This has posed a serious threat to social stability. During sudden public health events, panic buying typically complicates epidemic prevention and control efforts, leading to adverse consequences such as resource wastage, supply-demand imbalances, and market failures, which pose a threat to social stability and economic development. The progression of panic buying is significantly influenced by the actions and choices of both the public and local authorities. Therefore, studying the impact of the behavioral decisions made by the public and local governments plays a pivotal role in the evolution of such events. Building upon this premise, this paper studies the role of behavioral decisions in the COVID-19 panic buying event from the perspective of an evolutionary game. First, the public's attitude toward the development of the event is divided into two categories: those with a negative attitude and those with a positive attitude. At the same time, the concepts of mental benefits and mental costs are introduced and quantified, serving as key factors in public decision-making. Second, prospect theory is used to elucidate the risk preferences and loss aversion of decision-makers. An evolutionary game model is constructed with the public and local governments as the main entities based on prospect theory. The replication dynamic equation is constructed using the benefit perception matrix, and the equilibrium point and stability conditions of the model are deduced. Third, the impact of participants' behavioral decisions during the panic buying event on the event's evolution process is discussed through numerical simulation analysis. The results show that (1) in the context of sudden public health emergencies, material demand is the primary cause of public panic buying behavior. Postpanic buying events, such behavior is influenced primarily by the proportion of individuals with negative attitudes within the population. Local governments should release positive information regarding supplies in a timely manner during the nascent stage of panic buying events and actively monitor the proportion of individuals with negative attitudes. (2) There is a positive correlation between risk preference and public panic buying behavior, whereas loss aversion has the opposite effect. The spiritual benefits perceived by the public from engaging in panic buying increase with higher risk preference, whereas perceived costs related to health issues increase with deeper levels of loss aversion. (3) When response costs exceed what local governments are willing to bear, reputation gains and losses play a crucial role in their decision-making. The probability of local governments adopting responsive strategies increases with their emphasis on reputation and aversion to reputation losses. Higher-level governments should enhance the dissemination of positive and negative examples of government handling, enhancing local governments' sense of responsibility and honor to improve their perception of reputation gains and losses, thereby encouraging proactive management of panic buying events. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral decision-making; Evolutionary game theory; Loss aversion; Panic buying events; Prospect theory; Risk appetite","behavioral response; consumption behavior; COVID-19; decision making; game theory; theoretical study","","","","","National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China, (22&ZD162); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY22G010004); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; Zhejiang Gongshang University, ZJSU, (SZJ2022B019); Zhejiang Gongshang University, ZJSU","This research is supported by the Major Program of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 22&ZD162), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. LY22G010004), as well as Zhejiang Gongshang University \u201Cdigital +\u201D discipline construction key project (Grant No. SZJ2022B019).","Ahmad F., Shah Z., Al-Fagih L., Applications of evolutionary game theory in urban road transport network: a state of the art review, Sustain.

Due to its suddenness and variability, it poses a great threat to global human health and is a major problem currently faced by the medical and health fields. Objective: COVID-19 is the seventh known coronavirus that can infect humans. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the effective components and action targets of the Longyi Zhengqi formula and Lianhua Qingwen formula, study their mechanism of action in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (new coronavirus pneumonia), compare the similarities and differences of their pharmacological effects, and obtain the pharmacodynamic mechanism of the two traditional Chinese medicine compounds. Methods: Obtain the effective ingredients and targets of Longyi-Zhengqi Formula and Lianhua-Qingwen Formula from ETCM (Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine) and other traditional Chinese medicine databases, use GeneCards database to obtain the relevant targets of COVID-19, and use Cytoscape software to build the component COVID-19 target network of Longyi-Zhengqi Formula and the component COVID-19 target network of Lianhua-Qingwen Formula. STRING was used to construct a protein interaction network and screen key targets. GO (Gene Ontology) was used for enrichment analysis and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) was used for pathways to find out the targets and pathways related to the treatment of COVID-19. Results: In the GO enrichment analysis results, there are 106 biological processes, 31 cell localization and 28 molecular functions of the intersection PPI network targets of Longyi-Zhengqi Formula-COVID-19, 224 biological processes, 51 cell localization and 55 molecular functions of the intersection PPI network targets of Lianhua-Qingwen Formula-COVID-19. In the KEGG pathway analysis results, the number of targets of Longyi-Zhengqi Formula on the COVID-19 pathway is 7, and the number of targets of Lianhua-Qingwen Formula on the COVID-19 pathway is 19; In the regulation analysis results, Longyi-Zhengqi Formula achieves the effect of treating COVID-19 by regulating IL-6, and Lianhua-Qingwen Formula achieves the effect of treating pneumonia by regulating TLR4. Conclusion: This paper explores the mechanism of action of Longyi-Zhengqi Formula and Lianhua-Qingwen Formula in treating COVID-19 based on the method of network pharmacology, and provides a theoretical basis for traditional Chinese medicine to treat sudden diseases caused by human coronavirus in terms of drug targets and disease interactions. It has certain practical significance. © 2024 The Author(s).","GO enrichment analysis; human coronavirus; KEGG pathway analysis; PPI network; Target network; traditional chinese medicine","Coronavirus; Gene Ontology; Medicinal chemistry; adenine nucleoside; antivirus agent; apigenin; atractylenolide III; Chinese medicinal formula; decanoic acid; glycyrrhetinic acid; interleukin 6; isoliquiritigenin; kaempferol; lauric acid; lianhua qingwen; longyi zhengqi; luteolin; methyl 18 hydroxyglycyrrhetate; salidroside; toll like receptor 4; unclassified drug; Coronaviruses; Gene ontology; Gene ontology enrichment analyze; Human coronavirus; Kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genome pathway analyze; Ontology enrichment; Pathway analysis; PPI network; Target network; Traditional Chinese Medicine; antiviral activity; Article; cellular distribution; Chinese medicine; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 pneumonia; data base; drug efficacy; drug screening; drug targeting; gene ontology; human; KEGG; medical research; pathway enrichment analysis; protein protein interaction; COVID-19","","apigenin, 520-36-5; decanoic acid, 334-48-5, 3398-75-2; glycyrrhetinic acid, 471-53-4; isoliquiritigenin, 29913-71-1, 961-29-5; kaempferol, 520-18-3; lauric acid, 115-05-9, 143-07-7; luteolin, 491-70-3; salidroside, 10338-51-9; toll like receptor 4, 203811-83-0","","","Joint Research Funds for Medical and Engineering and Scientific Research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, (YG2021ZD02); Intergovernmental International Scientific and Technological Innovation and Cooperation Program of The National Key R&D Program, (2023YFE0199200); Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT, (KQ2002); Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT; Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province, (202300410102); Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61832019, 32030063, 62072157, 32070662); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62072157, 32070662, 61832019, 32030063), Intergovernmental International Scientific and Technological Innovation and Cooperation Program of The National Key R&D Program (Grant no. 2023YFE0199200) and Joint Research Funds for Medical and Engineering and Scientific Research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Grant no.

Utilising a GARCH methodology, the research examines ETF returns while considering significant COVID-19-related events to assess their impact. The study diverges from the conventional narrative of SIN stocks’ superiority by illustrating the resilience and outperformance of SRI ETFs in terms of returns and volatility stability during the pandemic. This finding challenges previous assertions in the literature and suggests a potential paradigm shift in investment strategies during periods of global crisis. The results underscore the importance of integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions, especially in turbulent times. This study offers investors actionable insights into the benefits of SRI ETFs, demonstrating their ability to provide stable returns and reduced risk during economic downturns. Fund managers can leverage these findings to align their portfolios with ESG principles, enhancing resilience against future crises. Policymakers can also draw on this evidence to promote sustainable investment frameworks that support long-term financial stability. Overall, this study contributes to the evolving discourse on sustainable investing, positioning SRI as a viable approach that balances financial performance with societal impact. © 2024 The Author(s)","COVID-19; ESG; ETFs; Financial crises; SIN; SRI","","","","","","","","Akyildirim E., Corbet S., Ongena S., Oxley L., (2023); Aliber R.Z., Kindleberger C.P., McCauley R.N., Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, (2015); Ashraf B.N., Stock markets’ reaction to COVID-19: Cases or fatalities?, Res.

E-commerce, crucial for the food sector especially post-COVID-19, influences consumer choices through reviews and feedback, significantly affecting consumer engagement, satisfaction, trust, and purchase intentions. Despite extensive research on consumer behavior, there's a gap in understanding post-purchase satisfaction, especially within wine e-commerce. This study aims to address this by examining wine consumer feedback on leading wine e-commerce platforms in three prominent markets: China, the UK, and the US. It aims to help online wine sellers in developing targeted marketing strategies to enhance consumer satisfaction and sales in each unique wine market. Through text mining, the study reveals market-specific differences in consumers' sentiments, preferences, and aversions arising from their online wine shopping experiences, providing a detailed guide for wine producers and e-commerce platforms to optimize their products and online services. © 2024 The Authors","online reviews; sentiment analysis; wine e-commerce","China; United Kingdom; United States; comparative study; consumption behavior; electronic commerce; optimization; wine","","","","","","","Ansari S., Gupta S., Customer perception of the deceptiveness of online product reviews: a speech act theory perspective, Int.

The results reveal that APEC currencies have time-varying effects (tend to cluster in appreciation and depreciation patterns in both the short and long term) and have generated higher total return spillover during COVID-19 (in the time domain) than the Russia-Ukraine war and SVB collapse. During COVID-19 (87.18 %) (total return spillover), impacts were more severe than the Russia-Ukraine crisis (79.49 %) and the Silicon Valley Bank collapse (75.55 %). Moreover, the South Korean won, Thai Bhat and Australian Dollar are identified as consistent shock transmitters, and Malaysian Ringgit, Philippine peso, Indonesian Rupiah, and Chinese Yuan as consistent shock receivers in the time domain. The findings have substantial repercussions for financial regulators and investors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation; COVID-19; Currency exchange rate; Russia–Ukraine war; Silicon valley bank collapse; Spillover","","","","","","","","Aharon D.Y., Ali S., A high-frequency data dive into SVB collapse, Financ.

The pandemic has worsened the condition of patients with chronic diseases like women with endometriosis. Objective: This study aims to summarize available evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical symptoms, mental health, and medical care of patients with endometriosis Methods: In the present integrative review using PRISMA guidelines, related articles published from December 2019 to July 2023 in databases including MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar in the English language were extracted. Results: After evaluating the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, a total of 23 articles were chosen and examined. This study represents an open window to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on women with endometriosis. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the symptoms, mental well-being, and medical care of women with endometriosis. Conclusions: There is a perceived necessity to provide supportive care for patients during pandemic restrictions. Remote work has had an unanticipated advantage, and it is recommended that women with endometriosis continue to work from home after COVID-19 to maintain their workplace effectiveness. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.","COVID-19; Endometriosis; mental health; pandemic; review; symptoms","coronavirus disease 2019; depression; domestic violence; endometriosis; female; health behavior; health care access; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; in vitro fertilization; infertility therapy; medical care; menstrual cycle; mental health; Papanicolaou test; physical activity; prevalence; psychological well-being; psychotherapy; quality of life; questionnaire; Review; risk factor; sexual behavior; social support; stretching exercise; systematic review; telecommuting; telemedicine; uterus cavity; workplace; yoga","","","","","","","Schwab R, Anic K, Stewen K, Et al., Pain experience and social support of endometriosis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany-results of a web-based cross-sectional survey, PLoS One, 16, 8, (2021); Spinelli A, Pellino G., COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives on an unfolding crisis, Br J Surg, 107, 7, pp. 785-787, (2020); Mulita F, Vailas M, Tchabashvili L, Liolis E, Iliopoulos F, Drakos N., The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on emergency surgery: A Greek emergency department experience, Prz Gastroenterol, 16, 1, (2021); Mulita F, Sotiropoulou M, Vailas M., A multifaceted virus.

While some nutraceuticals are safe, others have an inherent toxic potential. For a large number of nutraceuticals, no toxicity/safety data are available due to a lack of pharmacological/toxicological studies. The safety of some nutraceuticals can be compromised via contamination with toxic plants, metals, mycotoxins, pesticides, fertilizers, drugs of abuse, etc. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies and biomarkers of exposure, effect, and susceptibility appears to play a pivotal role in the safety and toxicity assessment of nutraceuticals. Interaction studies are essential to determine efficacy, safety, and toxicity when nutraceuticals and therapeutic drugs are used concomitantly or when polypharmacy is involved. This chapter describes various aspects of nutraceuticals, particularly their toxic potential, and the factors that influence their safety. © 2025.

Background: Female medical students, juggling demanding academic schedules, face the additional challenge of managing the impact of their monthly cycles on daily routines, academic achievements, and professional obligations. Objective: To investigate the factors influencing the menstrual cycle during this particularly stressful period by surveying these students. Methods: This cross-sectional study was from the 3rd year of female medical students studying fulltime. Results: Individuals in the severe stress group experienced irregular periods in 100% of cases. Dysmenorrhea was the next most prevalent abnormal symptom, affecting 39.7% of students. Furthermore, abdominal pain and lower back pain were the most common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The percentage of menorrhagia in the overweight-obesity group was almost 5 times higher than that of the other groups. Besides, central obesity increased the incidence of menorrhagia by a factor of 19. Average to high levels of physical activity can increase the risk of having dysmenorrhea. Remarkably, students who were affected by COVID-19 in terms of quality of life were also more likely to experience dysmenorrhea. Conclusion: Although most medical students had normal menstrual cycles, abdominal pain and lower back pain were the leading PMS. Moreover, overweight-obesity, central obesity, physical activity, stress, and the COVID-19 pandemic may be relative factors of the menstrual cycle. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.","COVID-19; COVID-19; medical students; menorrhagia; Menstrual cycle; premenstrual syndrome","abdominal discomfort; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; adult; Article; body mass; chest tightness; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; dysmenorrhea; female; headache; human; human experiment; international physical activity questionnaire; low back pain; medical student; menorrhagia; menstrual cycle; menstrual irregularity; metabolic equivalent; obesity; pandemic; physical activity; physiological stress; premenstrual syndrome; quality of life; underweight; Vietnamese","","","SPSS 26.0 software, SPSS","SPSS","Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy","This study was supported by Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy.

Several neuropeptides act as immune system regulators, which nerve terminals release as co-transmitters. It has been suggested that Neuropeptide Y (NPY) may be involved in inflammatory diseases through its ability to regulate the function of inflammatory cells. Consequently, the present study was designed to examine the changes in this neuropeptide in the serum of patients with Covid-19 disease, particularly following anti-inflammatory treatment, and its relationship with other inflammatory factors such as TNF-α. METHODS: The demographic information, vital and clinical signs (blood oxygen saturation level, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature), laboratory factors such as blood factors, inflammation, and blood electrolytes, as well as the use of steroids, were collected before and after steroid treatment the patient files. As part of the study, serum samples from patients were used to measure levels of NPY and TNF-α inflammatory factors using an ELISA kit. Additionally, the correlation between NPY values, other inflammatory factors, and other variables was examined before and after treatment. RESULTS: NPY, TNF-α, c-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were significantly reduced after steroid treatment. But the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) factor level increased after treatment compared to the initial evaluation. Lymphocytes and neutrophils also changed after drug treatment. Results indicated a high correlation between NPY and TNF-α. In addition to TNF-α, NPY, creatinine, and BUN presented a direct and significant relationship. ESR and BUN factors showed a positive and significant correlation regarding the length of hospitalization. However, the correlation between NPY and TNF-α with hospitalization length was insignificant. CONCLUSION: Since the current study had a significant association between NPY and TNF-α, the regulating function of this peptide in Covid-19 inflammatory processes may be validated. Enough that it is crucial to consider NPY as a marker and its antagonist as a potential Covid-19 therapy. Also, the considerable reduction in NPY levels after steroid therapy to lower inflammatory variables supports the regulatory function of this peptide in inflammatory processes.","Covid-19; Inflammation; Neuropeptide Y; TNF-α; Biomarker; Immunomodulators; Steroid Drugs.","COVID-19; Hospitals; Humans; Neuropeptide Y; Steroids; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; neuropeptide Y; steroid; tumor necrosis factor; coronavirus disease 2019; hospital; human; metabolism","","neuropeptide Y, 82785-45-3, 83589-17-7; Neuropeptide Y, ; Steroids, ; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1028768X","","","38073167","English","Acta Neurol Taiwan","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179641128"

Nucleic acid testing as an authoritative tool, is cumbersome, time-consuming, and easy to cross-infect, while the available antibody self-testing kits are deficient in sensitivity and stability. In this study, we developed competitive aptamer-based lateral flow devices (Apt-LFDs) for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. Molecular docking simulation was used to analyze the active binding sites of the aptamer to S protein, guiding complementary DNA (cDNA) design. Then a highly efficient freezing strategy was applied for the conjugation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and DNA probes. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of the constructed Apt-LFDs was 0.1–1 μg/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 51.81 ng/mL. The cross-reactivity test and stability test of the Apt-LFDs showed good specificity and reliability. The Apt-LFDs had recoveries ranging from 89.45 % to 117.12 % in pharyngeal swabs. Notably, the uncertainty of the analytical result was evaluated using a “bottom-up” approach. At a 95 % confidence level, the uncertainty report of (453.37±54.86) ng/mL with k = 2 was yielded. Overall, this study provides an important reference for the convenient and reliable detection of virus proteins based on LFDs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Aptamer; Lateral flow devices; SARS-CoV-2 S protein; Uncertainty assessment","SARS; Aptamers; Early diagnosis; Flow devices; Lateral Flow; Lateral flow device; Rapid detection; SARS-CoV-2 S protein; Self-testing; Uncertainty; Uncertainty assessment; Molecular docking","","","","","BUCTCJFH; Beijing University of Chemical Technology, BUCT; BRC-BC; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, CJFH, (RZ2020-02); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31801620); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFF0203703)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Joint Project of BRC-BC (Biomedical Translational Engineering Research Center of BUCTCJFH) (RZ2020-02), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31801620), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFF0203703). ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Beijing University of Chemical Technology\u2013China-Japan Friendship Hospital Biomedical Transformation Engineering Research Center Joint Project (No. RZ2020-02), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31801620), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFF0203703).","COVID is here to stay: countries must decide how to adapt, Nature, 601, (2022); Zhu Y., Jiang W., Chen R., Jouha J., Wang Q., Wu L., Qin Y., A post-pandemic perspective: Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 early detection, TrAC, Trends Anal.

To extract valuable insights and understand the meaning behind social media text content, using conventional machine learning methods, text mining solutions have been created. Through these techniques, messages are intended to be categorized into several themes, such counsel and caution. Nevertheless, these methods frequently focus on a single event and have trouble generalizing to cross events classifications. The effectiveness of traditional models trained on historical data for classifying social media messages from future events remains unclear. Our research focuses on the efficacy of a CNN model in classifying Twitter topics across diverse events. Three geotagged datasets from twitter gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic’s management are the subject of this study. Two conventional machine learning techniques (LR and SVM) are contrasted with the CNN model’s performance. Our experiments conclusively show that the CNN model significantly surpasses the performance of both SVM and LR models in terms of accuracy, regardless of whether the evaluation is based on individual events or across different events. This implies that the CNN model may efficiently categorize messages for impending events and pre-train on Twitter data from past occurrences, improving situational awareness. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the CNN model’s capability compared to traditional machine learning techniques for disaster management. © 2025 The Author(s).","","Classification (of information); COVID-19; Disaster prevention; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Text processing; CNN models; Conventional machines; Disaster management; Image-based; Machine learning techniques; Multilevels; Performance; Social media; Social media platforms; Text classification; Disasters","","","","","","","Cao M., Bai Y., Cao Z., Nie L., Zhang M., Efficient image-text retrieval via keyword-guided prescreening, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, (2023); Dao S.D., Huynh D., Zhao H., Phung D., Cai J., Open-vocabulary multi-label image classification with pretrained vision-language model, Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), pp. 2135-2140, (2023); Gao Q., Lim S., A probabilistic fusion of a support vector machine and a joint sparsity model for hyperspectral imagery classification, Giscience & Remote Sensing, 56, pp. 1129-1147, (2019); Hou Q., Han M., Qu F., He J.S., Understanding social media beyond text: A reliable practice on Twitter, Computational Social Networks, 8, pp. 1-20, (2020); Jones P., Sharma S., Moon C., Samatova N.F., A network-fusion guided dashboard interface for task-centric document curation, Proceedings of the 22Nd International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces., (2017); Khan M.A., Sarfraz M.S., Alhaisoni M.M., Albesher A.A., Wang S., Ashraf I., StomachNet: Optimal deep learning features fusion for stomach abnormalities classification, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 197969-197981, (2020); Miao J., Luo Z., Wang Y., Li G., Comparison and data fusion of an electronic nose and nearinfrared reflectance spectroscopy for the discrimination of ginsengs, Analytical Methods, 8, pp. 1265-1273, (2016); Nasersharif B., Yazdani M., Evolutionary fusion of classifiers trained on linear prediction based features for replay attack detection, Expert Systems, (2021); Saeedi J., Faez K., A classification and fuzzy-based approach for digital multi-focus image fusion, Pattern Analysis and Applications, 16, pp. 365-379, (2013); Takruri M., Rashad M.W., Attia H., Multi-classifier decision fusion for enhancing melanoma recognition accuracy. 2016 5th International Conference on Electronic Devices, Systems and Applications (ICEDSA), pp. 1-5, (2016); Tao Y., Cui Z., Wenjun Z., A multi-label text classification method based on labels vector fusion, 2018 International Conference on Promising Electronic Technologies (ICPET), (2018); Wang L., Chen X., Ye Z., Jiang S., Multimodal multi-label text classification based on bidirectional Transformer, Proceedings of the 2023 5Th International Conference on Robotics and Computer Vision (ICRCV), pp. 119-123, (2023); Yang F., Bansal M., Feature Fusion by Similarity Regression for Logo Retrieval, 2015 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pp. 959-959, (2015); Yang Y., Hsu J., Lofgren K., Cho W., Correction to: Cross-platform comparison of framed topics in Twitter and Weibo: Machine learning approaches to social media text mining, Social Network Analysis and Mining, (2022); Yuan H., Su H., Liu H., Wang Y., Yang H., Hou J., PQA-Net: Deep no reference point cloud quality assessment via multi-view projection, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 31, pp. 4645-5466, (2021)","","Gupta A.","CRC Press/Balkema","","2nd International Conference on Next-Generation Computing and Information Systems, ICNGCIS 2023","18 December 2023 through 19 December 2023","Jammu and Kashmir","315089","","978-103273865-9","","","English","Next Gener.

Psychological inoculation–where recipients are warned about the misleading techniques used in misinformation–is a potential intervention which could preemptively boost public resistance against misinformation. Cranky Uncle Vaccine is an interactive, digital game that applies inoculation, offering a scalable tool building public resilience against vaccine misinformation and promoting positive health-related behaviors. In this study, we document the process of developing and testing a West African version of Cranky Uncle Vaccine, with co-design workshops and a pilot test conducted in urban and peri-urban areas of the Greater Accra region of Ghana with 829 young people who had access to mobile and computer devices. The average age was 21.8 and participants were highly educated (median education level “Some/all university”) with slightly more females (51.2%) than males (48.4%). Pilot participants filled out surveys before and after playing the game, measuring vaccine attitudes (pre-game M = 3.4, post-game M = 3.6), intent to get vaccinated (pre-game M = 3.5, post-game M = 3.6), and discernment between vaccine facts and fallacies (pre-game AUC = 0.72, post-game AUC = 0.75). We observed a significant improvement in attitudes toward vaccines, with players demonstrating increased likelihood to get vaccinated after completing the game. Among players who indicated that they were unlikely to get vaccinated in the pre-game survey (N = 52, or 6.3% of participants), just over half of these participants (53%) switched to likely to get vaccinated after playing the game. Perceived reliability of vaccine facts remained the same, while perceived reliability of vaccine fallacies significantly decreased, indicating improved ability to spot misleading arguments about vaccines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a digital game in building public resilience against vaccine misinformation as well as improving vaccine attitudes and intent to get vaccinated. © 2024 The Author(s).

The system operates through five key stages: symptom-based diagnostic testing, AI-powered cough detection, analysis of X-ray and CT scan images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), evaluation of vital signs, and the geolocation of COVID-19 patients using GPS. Cough detection is enhanced by integrating Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Trained on an extensive dataset comprising over 5,856 CT scans, 7135 X-ray images, and over 30,000 crowdsourced cough recordings, the system demonstrates a high accuracy rate of 95% in identifying potential epidemic cases. This fusion of techniques offers a robust solution for early detection and rapid intervention, significantly mitigating the risk of widespread transmission within high-density environments. © 2025, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

However, their use has side effects raising the possibility that they may be harmful in its management. Following the principle of primum non nocere, we used biochemical pathways to model a complicated patient’s condition to predict this eventuality. Case Description: We present the case of a 60-year-old man with progressive sarcoidosis who was receiving glucocorticoids and contracted COVID-19. He was admitted to a hospital, stabilized, discharged and then worsened. He declined re-admission and was managed at home by family members under the tele-supervision of an intensivist. To individualize management, we modelled his biochemical pathogenesis graphically in the form of a PathoBiocheModel, emphasizing the roles of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and triiodothyronine (T3). It was developed using his personal data—clinical course and laboratory biomarkers—and published data that was extracted and integrated by sci.AI machine reasoning methods. Based on the PathoBiocheModel—which was validated by the group of our authors— we recognized an underlying insulin resistance which affected the patient’s G6PD status, and therapeutic interventions were modified. The patient successfully recovered. Inspired by his good outcome, we discuss our insights, using biochemical rationale, on the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid use in COVID-19. Conclusions: While glucocorticoids are used for COVID-19, in our case report we demonstrated that they were harmful. They aggravated an underlying insulin resistance and G6PD deficiency, as a consequence, that potentiates COVID-19. And, interestingly, this was reflected by T3 levels used as a biomarker. © Journal of Medical Artificial Intelligence.

The study reveals that TMU has a strong predictive ability for stock volatility from both in- and out-of-sample perspectives. Interestingly, despite Twitter being inaccessible in China, the interconnectedness of global financial markets allows it to indirectly impact China's stock market volatility. The research also highlights that TMU plays a particularly significant role in forecasting stock market volatility during turbulent periods, such as the COVID-19 epidemic. Furthermore, integrating TMU into the volatility prediction framework leads to an improvement in economic value. These findings are essential for policymakers to develop effective market-stabilizing policies and for investors to enhance the management of their investment portfolios. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Out-of-sample;

The research sought to mitigate aspects related to the technological gap, which became more evident with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, exposing the deficiencies of internet connectivity in some countries. In some regions of Latin America, in particular, there is a lack of internet access. Therefore, the implementation of a platform was proposed in which technologies converge to optimize the use of internet resources, integrating didactic and pedagogical aspects, generating an added value with the incorporation of an intelligent conversational agent as a means of effective communication between students and teachers. In the technological aspects, a focused mapping was carried out to identify the appropriate technologies to implement the platform. In terms of didactics, we worked with the ASSURE instructional design employing a cognitivist approach. Methodologically, a mixed-research approach was carried out; with the application of perception surveys to teachers and students belonging to secondary education institutions in Colombia, the validation of the platform was carried out through the expert judgment technique. The results show that the asynchronous platform mediated by intelligent conversational agents was positively evaluated by students and teachers.

This technology can be rapidly adapted to emerging infectious diseases, making an essential tool to contain future pandemics. To detect viral RNA, the highly conserved E-gene of the virus was targeted, allowing for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 presence or absence using nasopharyngeal swab samples. For N-protein detection, specific antibodies were used. Tested on 213 clinical nasopharyngeal samples, the gFET biosensor showed good correlation with RT-PCR cycle threshold values, proving its high sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Specificity was confirmed using 21 pre-pandemic samples positive for other respiratory viruses. The gFET biosensor had a limit of detection (LOD) for N-protein of 0.9 pM, establishing a foundation for the development of a sensitive tool for monitoring active viral infection. Results of gFET based N-protein detection corresponded to the results of virus culture in all 16 available clinical samples and thus it also proved its capability to serve as a proxy for infectivity. Overall, these findings support the potential of the gFET biosensor as a point-of-care device for rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and indirect assessment of infectiousness in patients, providing additional information for clinical and public health decision-making. © 2024 The Authors","COVID-19; Diagnostics; Graphene field-effect transistor; Infectivity; Nucleocapsid protein; SARS-CoV-2","Diagnosis; Diseases; Field effect transistors; Graphene transistors; Surface discharges; carboxylic acid; graphene; Basic science; Detection capability; Diagnostic; Field effect transistor biosensors; Graphene field-effect transistors; Graphenes; Infectivity; Nucleocapsid proteins; Protein detection; Technology advancement; adult; aged; Article; basic science; clinical article; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; Human respiratory syncytial virus; immobilization; influenza A; influenza B; loop mediated isothermal amplification; male; middle aged; nucleic acid analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; receiver operating characteristic; Rhinovirus; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; virus detection; virus diagnosis; virus nucleocapsid; young adult; SARS","","","","","","","Arnaout R., Lee R.A., Lee G.R., Et al., Clin.

The effects of the immunization campaign on the WHO Southeast Asian countries were different, and the study used event study techniques and panel-data regression models to investigate the impact of the WHO South-East Asian capital market. Some countries like India, Sri Lanka, and South Korea had positive markets that responded to the news, while others did not. The findings of this study suggest that investors make fair assessments and respond to events and announcements, but they tend to have a more visible reaction to negative incidents than to positive news/events. However, after 51 days, the WHO South East region as a whole had internalized the encouraging news. The study has a few limitations, such as a small dataset and period, only a few variables and models, and so on. Future studies could include a few additional countries and periods to produce more significant results. Originality/value- This study contributes to the existing knowledge about the impact of drugs and vaccinations on stock markets. It is the first study to investigate how the WHO Southeast Asian Region's COVID-19 immunization program affects the stock market reaction.

The World Health Organization has declared it a global health emergency by 2020. Early intervention provides a more effective cure and relieves patients of unnecessary intensive care from hospitals and other healthcare facilities. However, that requires an accurate method for early disease detection. COVID-19 illness may eventually infect people, making it a severe condition. Research shows that COVID-19 pneumonia shares many clinical features with other forms of pneumonia, suggesting that COVID-19 can be a serious condition for those affected. The main symptom of the disease is high body temperature. Noncontact thermal imaging is one of the most important methods for measuring body temperature, although it has some performance limitations. Many of these thermal cameras are privately owned, not widely available, and are often owned by for-profit organizations. In this paper, we propose a real-time method for human temperature prediction and tracking based on facial skin temperature extraction for accurate COVID-19 case detection. The main idea of this paper is to use an automated deep-learning model for thermal skin temperature extraction. The optimization is based on using the deep semantic segmentation approach for fully automated thermal skin binary mask prediction using the thermal video only. The predicted mask is projected onto the original thermal video to extract the thermal skin mask, which is used to calculate the average thermal skin face temperature. The proposed deep semantic segmentation model is trained on the thermal skin binary mask dataset that is generated by using our first model a fully automated unsupervised learning approach for camera calibration and thermal skin binary mask extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can automatically predict better binary skin-mak than our first model which leads to a very high-efficiency human temperature tracking using thermal videos only compared with the Ground Truth using the Speaking Faces thermal datasets. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

Another transmittable infection called Pneumonia is mainly attributable to infection because of bacteria in the alveoli of the lungs. Once a diseased lung tissue has infection, it elevates excretion in it. Specialists conduct health examinations and identify the patient through ultrasound, biopsy, or Chest X-ray of lungs to identify whether the patient has these diseases. Incorrect treatment, misdiagnosis, and if the disease was disregarded will result in the fatality. The development of Deep Learning and neutrosophic set (NS) supports the decision-making procedure of professionals to identify patients with this disease. NS is a prolongation of the fuzzy set and classical theories. The NS determines three memberships such as T, I and F. T, I, and F display the degree of truth, the false, and the indeterminacy membership, correspondingly. This enables a more nuanced representation of contradiction, uncertainty, and ambiguity within the dataset, allowing superior handling of imprecise and complex data. This study develops a new Deep learning with Neutrosophic Set-Based k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier for disease detection (DLNSKNN-DD) technique. The major purpose of the DLNSKNN-DD method is to identify the existence of virus pneumonia and COVID-19. In the DLNSKNN-DD technique, the feature extraction from the medical images is carried out by residual network (ResNet50v2). Moreover, the parameter tuning of the ResNetv2 model is done using Adadelta optimizer. The DLNSKNN-DD technique exploits NSKNN model for classification purposes. The performance evaluation of the DLNSKNN-DD algorithm can be assessed on medicinal image dataset. The experimental outcomes underlined the effectual recognition results of the DLNSKNN-DD technique on the identification of diseases. © 2025, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

All students completed a 13-item survey to evaluate the impact their participation in the virtual conference had on their overall learning and how similar opportunities could impact their future learning experiences. Results: When asked to rate on a scale from 1 (did NOT improve at all) to 5 (greatly improved my learning), 93% (26/28) of students rated their change in learning after attending the student-led conference as a four or five. Students identified that participation enhanced their drug/disease state knowledge, improved their presentation skills and/or improved their critical thinking and clinical application skills. Conclusion: In the future, advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) can consider the inclusion of peer education through an online platform as a strategy to facilitate learning in pharmacy programmes. © 2024, International Pharmaceutical Federation.

The study found that these markets were less inter-connected during oil battles and the Russia–Ukraine conflict but more inter-connected during the COVID-19 crisis. Findings indicated that Oman, Kuwait, gold, and Qatar are the most significant spillover receivers, whereas the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and West Texas Intermediate are the primary risk spillover transmitters in the Israel–Palestine conflict. Additionally, BTC and the UAE are significant transmitters, whereas Kuwait and Qatar are the highest-risk spillover receivers in the Russia–Ukraine war. Portfolio estimates revealed that gold, BTC, and/or oil are useful in various equity markets for portfolio diversification and hedging under different market conditions and time horizons.

This study evaluates the impact of health education on pregnant women's knowledge of COVID-19, aiming to improve their adherence to preventive measures and safeguard maternal and fetal health. Objective: This study aims to assess the impact of health education on pregnant women's understanding of the prevention and transmission of the coronavirus (Covid-19). Methods: This study utilizes a Quasi-Experimental method employing a one-group pretest-posttest design. It is slated to occur from October to November 2021 at the Moti Health Center in Bantaeng Regency, with a sample of 30 pregnant women. Purposive sampling was employed to select participants from those attending the MCH Poly who met predetermined inclusion criteria and expressed willingness to take part in the study. Results: The bivariate analysis yielded a p-value of 0.003 before and after providing health education, indicating a statistically significant improvement in knowledge. Specifically, the mean knowledge scores increased from the pretest to the posttest phase, demonstrating that the participants better understood COVID-19 prevention and transmission after the intervention. These findings suggest that targeted health education can effectively improve health literacy among pregnant women, a vulnerable group during the pandemic. Conclusion: Health education plays a crucial role in shaping the understanding of pregnant women concerning adherence to measures for preventing and mitigating the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Through enhanced knowledge, pregnant women become more conscious of the essential measures to safeguard themselves and their unborn children. Therefore, midwives, particularly those working in health services such as Puskesmas, are encouraged to continue to provide consistent health education to pregnant women regarding COVID-19 transmission prevention. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

Economic crises highlight the sustainable competitiveness of firms, providing an opportunity to identify the role of OC. OC is intangible capital that encompasses intrinsic business processes and expertise, facilitating more efficient resource utilization than competitors. Results show that a greater OC is significantly associated with higher stock returns during both crisis periods. The association is robust to the models with firm-fixed effects and instrumental variables. In addition, we find evidence that generalist CEOs strengthen this relationship while specialist CEOs do not. This study emphasizes the pivotal role of OC as a protective buffer against external shocks, particularly during periods when the market pays more attention to corporate sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Economic Crisis; Generalist CEO; Organization Capital; Specialist CEO; Stock Return","","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, KAIST; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2023S1A5A8081512)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2023S1A5A8081512). ; Funding text 2: We thank Claudia Cust\u00F3dio for providing the General Ability Index data and encouraging this project.

While most literature focused on finding patterns for home and work activities, we further investigated non-home and non-work-related activities to detect patterns associated with them. Temporal attributes of activities are extracted from trip information recorded by Tehran subway's automatic fare collection system. In addition, land-use data is also incorporated to further enhance spatial attributes for non-home/work activities. Various activity attributes such as start time, duration, and frequency in addition to land-use data are used to infer the activity purposes and patterns. We identified 14 different patterns related to non-commuting activities on the basis of both their temporal and spatial attributes including educational, recreational, commercial, and health and other service-related activity types. We investigated passengers’ activity pattern and behavior changes before and during COVID-19 pandemic by comparing the discovered patterns. For recreational patterns it is revealed that not only has the number of recreational patterns dropped, but also the duration of recreational activities decreased. Morning patterns of educational activities have also been eliminated and number of commercial activities was decreased during COVID-19. The proposed model demonstrates the ability to capture travel behavior changes for different disruptions using smart card transit data without performing costly and time consuming manual surveys which can be useful for authorties and decision makers. © 2024 The Author(s)","Activity pattern; COVID-19 impact; Land use data; Topic modeling; Transit smart card","","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Department of Civil Engineering and Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary","This work was financially supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant on \u201CUrban Transit System Diagnosis, Monitoring, and Management using Mobility Sensing Data\u201D, Department of Civil Engineering and Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary.

These changes in workplace policies aim to reduce the spread and exposure of the airborne virus leading to a reduction in labor exposure hours since the emergence of the pandemic in 2020. However, it is uncertain whether the adjusted count of claims related to workplace injuries, illnesses, and fatalities in the construction sector was significantly reduced despite the decreased labor exposure hours. The compounded risks of uncontrolled construction hazards and COVID-19 exposure have adverse effects on the following levels: (1) Alberta’s economy due to the total amount of claims expenditure; (2) financial burden on construction-related businesses due to lost productivity and costs associated with hiring and replacement of an injured worker; and (3) the societal level where workers and their families suffer lost wages due to disabling injuries. The present study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on health and safety claims within the Construction and Construction Trades Sector of Alberta. Moreover, the main sources for incidents are re-examined while analyzing which demographic group is exposed to greater risks. This is analyzed by aggregating the prevalence claims’ rate (non-COVID claims) with incidence rate claims (claims due to COVID-19) from the Workers’ Compensation Board of Alberta dataset. The study aims to provide evidence-based insights that will guide investment decisions, prevention efforts, and proactive programs in reducing workplace injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. © Canadian Society for Civil Engineering 2025.","Alberta construction industry; COVID-19; Injury claims; Worker’s compensation board","Commerce; Construction industry; Employment; Health hazards; Investments; Wages; Alberta; Alberta construction industry; Construction trades; Health and safety; Incidence rate; Injury claim; Trade sectors; Workers'; Worker’s compensation board; Workplace injuries; COVID-19","","","","","","","Accessed 21 Feb, 2023.

This study assessed the association between social support, psychological resilience, and probable COVID-19-related PTSD. Methods: The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) were used to assess for PTSD symptoms, social support, and resilience among COVID-19 patients treated at a large medical system in New York City between July 2020 and July 2023. Logistic regression evaluated the association between social support and resilience with PTSD. We further investigated whether associations differed across age, gender, site of acute care, vaccination status, and pre-existing mental disorders. Results: Among the 1484 participants, 16.6 % had probable COVID-19-related PTSD. Higher scores on measures of resilience (OR: 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.61–0.75) and social support (OR: 0.96, 95 % CI: 0.93–0.99) were associated with lower odds of probable COVID-19-related PTSD. The association between resilience and PTSD was moderated by sex (p for interaction = 0.001), with resilience showing a stronger negative association with PTSD among men relative to women. Associations between resilience, social support, and COVID-19-related PTSD did not differ by age, sites of acute care, vaccination status, and pre-existing mental disorders. Limitations: Cross-sectional design precludes establishing causal relationships; assessment timing was not considered; the short CD-RISC may limit measurement precision; single-center study may not be fully generalizable. Conclusions: These findings suggest that individuals with low social support and resilience may be at higher risk of PTSD and should be screened and be the target of preventive interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; PTSD; Resilience; Social support; Trauma","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; Article; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical feature; comorbidity; Connor Davidson resilience scale; coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19 testing; cross-sectional study; demographics; descriptive research; DSM-5; emergency care; female; groups by age; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; neuropathology; New York; people by vaccination status; posttraumatic stress disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder checklist-specific; psychological resilience; social support; sociodemographics; United States","","","","","Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, ISMMS","The Mount Sinai COVID-19 Registry is supported by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS).","Ahmed G.K., Khedr E.M., Hamad D.A., Meshref T.S., Hashem M.M., Aly M.M., Long term impact of Covid-19 infection on sleep and mental health: a cross-sectional study, Psychiatry Res., 305, (2021); Alam M.D., Paul S.K., Momi M., Ni L., Xu Y., Factors associated with psychological outcomes among vaccinated and unvaccinated health care workers against COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh, Front.

For this purpose, they construct differentiated discourses with emotional and ideological referents that legitimize government administration and configure a politicized collective identity. Therefore, this research analyzed the language used on Twitter (now X) of 18 mayors of the main cities of Colombia during the pandemic, with the objective of identifying frames of meaning of the threatening reality according to their political orientation (left-right). Methodology: Through a longitudinal non-experimental study, accounts were monitored for three weeks before and three weeks after the first officially registered case of COVID-19 in the country. Results: Right-wing mayors diffused mainly negative emotions to legitimize obedience; while left-wing mayors combined positive and negative emotions (anxiety and anger) to promote coping. Discussion: The findings reflect differentiated processes of collective identity that are politicized in the socio-political context of the health crisis. Conclusions: Further research on the instrumentalization of cognitive and emotional frames in the political context is recommended, given that they allow us to reveal communication strategies that influence public opinion as a frame of reference to overcome threatening situations at a global level. Also, the use of advanced data mining for the study of beliefs and emotions in real time that is communicated in digital media. © 2025, HISIN (History of Information Systems).

In Mexico, the Public Health Incident Management Command (COISS) strategy was implemented to improve health care for patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalization. Aim: To evaluate the impact of the COISS strategy on case fatality rates (CFR) and years of life lost (YLL) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: The COISS strategy included eight actions implemented in states with high epidemic risk (COISS states). A secondary analysis of the public database from the Mexican Ministry of Health was performed considering patients with confirmed diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COISS strategy effectiveness was evaluated by its impact on in-hospital CFR and YLL at the beginning (T0) and end (T1) of the third wave, and at the end of the fourth wave (T2) and compared to states without intervention (non-COISS states). Results: At T0, COISS states showed a higher CFR for hospitalized patients than non-COISS states, which decreased after the strategy implementation. After correction for baseline conditions, lower relative CFR at T1 and T2, compared to T0, and a protective effect in different age groups, especially in those ≥65 years, were found in hospitalized patients in COISS states. The COISS strategy was associated with lower CFR in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at both T1 and T2. At T0, YLLs were higher in COISS states, but there were no significant differences at T1 and T2. Conclusions: COISS interventions effectively reduced CFR in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, providing protection to vulnerable patients and reducing the YLL gap. © 2024 Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)","COVID-19; Health policy; Pandemics; Public health; Universal health coverage","adult; aged; Article; case fatality rate; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; groups by age; health care quality; hospitalization; human; in-hospital mortality; major clinical study; male; Mexico; pandemic; patient safety; public health service; risk factor; vulnerable population; years of potential life lost","","","","","","","Hospital Emergency Response checklist.

Design: Population-based self-controlled case series Methods: This study utilized nationwide claims and vaccination data provided by the Korea National Health Insurance Service and Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. From the entire South Korean population of 52 million individuals, patients with incident RAO, RVO, anterior NIU, nonanterior NIU, NIS, ON, ION, or OMCNP between January 2021 and March 2022 were included. The postvaccination risk period was defined as up to 56 days after COVID-19 vaccination. The relative incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for RAO, RVO, anterior NIU, nonanterior NIU, NIS, ON, ION, and OMCNP during the risk periods were measured using conditional Poisson regression. Results: The study included 6,590, 70,120, 137,958, 17,921, 15,492, 2,039, 49,089, and 11,312 cases of incident RAO, RVO, anterior NIU, nonanterior NIU, NIS, ON, ION, and OMCNP, respectively. The IRRs (95% confidence interval) during the early risk period (0-28 days) were 0.95 (0.88-1.01), 0.96 (0.94-0.98), 0.93 (0.91-0.94), 0.93 (0.89-0.96), 0.96 (0.92-1.01), 1.04 (0.92-1.18), 0.98 (0.95-1.00), and 0.91 (0.86-0.96), respectively. In the late risk period (29-56 days), the IRRs were 0.96 (0.89-1.03), 0.93 (0.91-0.96), 0.96 (0.95-0.98), 1.00 (0.95-1.04), 0.96 (0.91-1.01), 1.00 (0.87-1.15), 1.01 (0.98-1.04), and 0.95 (0.90-1.01), respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination did not increase the risk of incident RAO, RVO, anterior NIU, nonanterior NIU, NIS, ON, ION, or OMCNP during the postvaccination period. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","","astrazeneca;

Design: Prospective Case Series. Methods: 14 hips (10 patients) with ONFH following COVID-19 were treated with Free Vascularized Fibula graft from June 2021 to December 2022 and were subsequently evaluated monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months post operatively for functionality (Harris Hip Score), Femur head collapse and related complications. Results: Mean age of patients was 29.3 years (Range: 20–38 years). 14 diseased hips were classified on the basis of Steinberg classification as 4 stage 2B, 4 stage 3B and 6 stage 3C. The average follow up period was 2.1 years (Range: 12 months–34 months). Eight of fourteen hips survived and six progressed to collapse. Mean HHS at final follow-up was 68.3 in comparison to 65.8 pre-operatively. 4 fair and 4 poor HH scores were converted to 4 excellent and 4 good scores post-operatively. Two late complications were noted-one FHL contracture and one CPN neuroma. Conclusion: Free Vascularized Fibula Graft, as a hip salvage modality, showed optimal results in the treatment of COVID-19 related ONFH, which is associated with aggressive disease course and extensive involvement of femur head. © 2024 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation","","adult; Article; case study; clinical article; clinical evaluation; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; female; femur head necrosis; fibula graft; follow up; functional assessment; Harris hip score; human; human tissue; male; neuroma; outcome assessment; postoperative care; preoperative care; prospective study; survivorship; treatment planning; trend study","","","","","","","Pijnenburg L., Felten R., Javier R.M., Ostéonécroses aseptiques, une revue générale des ostéonécroses de la hanche, et au-delà [A review of avascular necrosis, of the hip and beyond], Rev Med Interne, 41, 1, pp. 27-36, (2020); Assouline-Dayan Y., Chang C., Greenspan A., Shoenfeld Y., Gershwin M.E., Pathogenesis and natural history of osteonecrosis, Semin Arthritis Rheum, 32, 2, pp. 94-124, (2002); Petek D., Hannouche D., Suva D., Osteonecrosis of the femoral head: pathophysiology and current concepts of treatment, Open Rev., 4, 3, pp. 85-97, (2019); Barney J., Piuzzi N.S., Akhondi H., Femoral head avascular necrosis, StatPearls, (2024); Cohen-Rosenblum A., Cui Q., Osteonecrosis of the femoral head, Orthop Clin N Am, 50, 2, pp. 139-149, (2019); Agarwala S.R., Vijayvargiya M., Pandey P., Avascular necrosis as a part of 'long COVID-19, BMJ Case Rep, 14, 7, (2021); Zhang S., Wang C., Shi L., Xue Q., Beware of steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head in the treatment of COVID-19-experience and lessons from the SARS epidemic, Drug Des Dev Ther, 15, pp. 983-995, (2021); Cho Y.J., Nam D.C., Jung K., Arthroplasty in femoral head osteonecrosis, Hip.

The management of the pandemic produced specific consequences, which further weakened the management of climate change, which had historical or chronic weaknesses that were also evident in the management of COVID-19. Through the seven principles of resilience proposed by researchers at the Stockholm Resilience Center, how the decisions of Peruvian authorities increased Peru’s state of vulnerability was analyzed; it was concluded that public management should provide the conditions to strengthen the organizational capacity of the population and not rely solely on models outside the national context. In this sense, optimal management of disturbances should consider an approach based on functional diversity and holistic knowledge, through a process of constant learning in the face of uncertainty and the dynamics of the socio-ecological system, involving a transdisciplinary approach through polycentric governance. This management would also involve what we call the “zero” principle of resilience. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

The functional data objects we study are random densities fs,t indexed by discrete time t and a vector component s, which can be treated as a broadly understood spatial location. Our main objective is to identify the set of components s, where a change occurs with statistical certainty. A challenge of this analysis is that the densities fs,t are not directly observable and must be estimated from sparse and potentially imbalanced data. Such setups are motivated by the analysis of two data sets that we investigate in this work. First, a hitherto unpublished large data set of Brazilian Covid infections and a second, a financial data set derived from intraday prices of U.S. Exchange Traded Funds. Chief statistical advances are the development of change point tests and estimators of components of change for multivariate time series of densities. We prove the theoretical validity of our methodology and investigate its finite sample performance in a simulation study. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Change points; Covid-19; Density functions; Sparse functional data; Spatially indexed functions","","","","","","United States NSF, (DMS–2123761)","This research was partially supported by the United States NSF grant DMS\u20132123761.","Horta E., Ziegelmann F., Dynamics of financial returns densities: A functional approach applied to the Bovespa intraday index, Int.

This poses a serious medical and social burden. This figure is projected to rise yearly, due to demographic and epidemiological factors, with an increase in the number of students with disabilities (SWDs) enrolling in higher education institutions (HEIs). This study reviews the status of library use and accessibility of SWDs to academic libraries. An extensive literature search was done using the keywords—“persons with disabilities”, “inclusive education”, “academic libraries”, and “assistive technologies”. Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and EBSCOHost were searched, and literature in the 2008–2018 decade was given priority consideration, being the period preceding the original study from which the current chapter emerged. The findings reveal the library needs of SWDs and the assistive technologies available for themIt also notes that in developed countries, disability is integrated into the broader institutional diversity agenda, unlike the fragmented way it is tackled in developing countries. Furthermore, despite the increased awareness of disability issues, and the development of enabling policy, legislation, and treaties at both national and international levels, SWDs in developing countries face more barriers to accessing academic libraries due to poor implementation. The chapter concludes that implementation regulations and funding are key to the success of inclusive library and information services. Considering the ever-increasing number of SWDs, HEIS must take pragmatic measures to cater to their needs by making provision for them. This implies creating a special niche for them within the academic library setting. We acknowledge recent changes in the trends, challenges, and opportunities in service provision to people experiencing disability that the study period would not have highlighted and recommends that future studies build on this discourse. It is hoped that such comparative discourse could help to establish the contextual impact of development, such as society 5.0, global unforeseen disasters, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, on the study area. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Africa; Disability; Higher education institutions; Libraries; Literature review; Students with disabilities","COVID-19; Disabled persons; Disasters; Economic and social effects; Laws and legislation; Libraries; Students; Academic libraries; Africa; Assistive technology; Demographic factors; Disability; Higher education institutions; Library services; Literature reviews; Service provisions; Student with disability; Assistive technology","","","","","","","Adeeko C.O., Personal factors, information literacy skills, library anxiety and library use by undergraduates in federal universities in North-Central, Nigeria [Doctoral Dissertation], (2021); Ahmad F.K., Use of assistive technology in inclusive education: Making room for diverse learning needs, Transcience, 6, 2, pp. 62-77, (2015); Alabi A.O., Mutula S.M., Digital inclusion for visually impaired students through assistive technologies in academic libraries, Library Hi Tech News, 37, 2, pp. 14-17, (2020); Albin K., From Braille code to smart book readers: Technology as a tool for reading emancipation of the visually impaired persons, Przegląd Kulturoznawczy, 53, 3, pp. 459-475, (2022); Anderson A., From mutual awareness to collaboration: Academic libraries and autism support programs, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 53, 1, pp. 103-115, (2021); Academic library impact on student learning and success: Findings from Assessment in Action Team Projects, Association of College and Research Libraries, (2017); Ayoung D.A., Baada F.N.A., Baayel P., Access to library services and facilities by persons with disability: Insights from academic libraries in Ghana, Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 53, 1, pp. 167-180, (2021); Bashiti A., Rahim A.A., Physical barriers faced by people with disabilities (PwDs) in shopping malls, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 222, pp. 414-422, (2016); Beyene W.M., Digital inclusion in library context: A perspective from users with print disability, Journal of Web Librarianship, 12, 2, pp. 121-140, (2018); Beyene W.M., Mekonnen A.T., Giannoumis G.A., Inclusion, access, and accessibility of educational resources in higher education institutions: Exploring the Ethiopian context, International Journal of Inclusive Education, 27, 1, pp. 18-34, (2023); Bocker A., Can non-discrimination law change hearts and minds?, Erasmus Law Review, 13, (2020); Bodaghi N.B., Cheong L.S., Zainab A.N., Librarians empathy: Visually impaired students’ experiences towards inclusion and sense of belonging in an academic library, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 42, 1, pp. 87-96, (2016); Bonnici L.J., Maatta S.L., Brodsky J., Second national accessibility survey: Librarians, patrons, and disabilities, New Library World, 116, 9-10, pp. 503-516, (2015); Carvalho M., Mandrekar B., Impact of academic library services on students success and performance, Library Philosophy and Practice, (2020); Chaputula A.H., Mapulanga P., Provision of library services to people with disabilities in Malawi, South African Journal of Libraries and Information Science, 82, 2, pp. 1-10, (2017); Chaputula A.H., Mutula S., EReadiness of public university libraries in Malawi to use mobile phones in the provision of library and information services, Library Hi Tech, 36, 2, pp. 270-288, (2018); Chijioke I.P., Chigozie N.M., Igbokwe C.J., Utilization of e-reference services by students with disabilities in the Federal University Libraries in the South East, Nigeria, Library Philosophy and Practice, pp. 1-15, (2020); Corredoira L., Communication Rights in an Internet-Based Society, pp. 30-46, (2021); Cox J., Positioning the academic library within the institution: A literature review, Positioning the Academic Library within the University, pp. 9-33, (2021); Cox J., The higher education environment driving academic library strategy: A political, economic, social and technological (PEST) analysis, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 47, 1, (2021); Cox A., Factors shaping future use and design of academic library space, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 29, 1, pp. 33-50, (2023); Cozzolino A., Corbo L., Aversa P., Digital platform-based ecosystems: The evolution of collaboration and competition between incumbent producers and entrant platforms, Journal of Business Research, 126, pp. 385-400, (2021); Deatherage E.A., Examining the relationship between library services use and fall-to-fall retention in community college libraries, University of Arkansas, (2021); Dube T.V., Jacobs L., Academic library services extension during the COVID-19 pandemic: Considerations in higher education institutions in the Gauteng Province.

The COVID-19 crisis has provided a unique opportunity to conduct thorough analyses of panic buying behavior in a real-world context. Furthermore, the pandemic has underscored the importance of understanding panic buying dynamics, given its significant impact on consumer behavior and supply chain resilience. While many studies have concentrated on the psychological aspects of this phenomenon, there exists a gap in exploring its impact on products and goods. Therefore, there is a critical need to examine its effects across various product categories. In this study, we employed innovative topic modeling techniques to examine panic buying behavior and its implications during the COVID-19 crisis. Leveraging data from the X platform, our study adopts a novel approach integrating Sentence-BERT and BERTopic methodologies to identify key topics across diverse product categories. By providing insights into the outcomes of panic buying, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior during crisis. Moreover, our findings hold considerable significance for policymakers and supply chain managers, offering insights to develop targeted interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of panic buying on supply chains and ensuring efficient resource allocation during future crises. ©2025 The author(s)","Consumer Behavior; Covid-19; Pandemic; Panic Buying; Topic Modeling","Distribution transformers; Buying behavior; Covid-19; Modelling techniques; Pandemic; Panic buying; Product categories; Psychological Aspects; Real-world; Supply chain resiliences; Topic Modeling; Resource allocation","","","","","","","Wu S, Shen Y, Geng Y, Chen T, Xi L., Consumer Panic Buying Behavior and Supply Distribution Strategy in a Multiregional Network after a Sudden Disaster, Systems, 11, 2, (2023); Yuen KF, Wang X, Ma F, Li KX., The psychological causes of panic buying following a health crisis, International journal of environmental research and public health, 17, 10, (2020); Omar NA, Nazri MA, Ali MH, Alam SS., The panic buying behavior of consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Examining the influences of uncertainty, perceptions of severity, perceptions of scarcity, and anxiety, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 62, (2021); Kroker A, Kroker M, Cook D., Panic USA: Hypermodernism as America's postmodernism, Social Problems, 37, 4, pp. 443-459, (1990); Sheu J-B, Kuo H-T., Dual speculative hoarding: A wholesaler-retailer channel behavioral phenomenon behind potential natural hazard threats, International journal of disaster risk reduction, 44, (2020); Miri SM, Roozbeh F, Omranirad A, Alavian SM., Panic of buying toilet papers: a historical memory or a horrible truth?

It is expected that the pandemic will continue to significantly shape people's attitudes towards environmental issues in the foreseeable future. Against this backdrop, the present study sought to explore the environmental attitudes of students in the faculty of economics within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new ecological paradigm (NEP). This cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestine, spanning from June 20, 2021, to May 5, 2022. The study targeted students enrolled in private or public universities in Palestine during the academic year 2021–2022, with a total of 2118 students from various Palestinian universities participating. Overall, the study findings revealed that a significant proportion of the Palestinian student sample endorsed the NEP. With an average score of 3.72 across the entire NEP scale, the findings suggested that the ecological attitudes of the sample leaned more towards alignment with the NEP. In conclusion, the results indicated that students in the faculty of economics tended to espouse an ecocentric viewpoint over an anthropocentric one. The advent of pandemics or epidemics is expected to influence people's perceptions of nature, the environment, resources, and ultimately shape global responses to crises, particularly among students in the faculty of economics. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. We retrospectively collected the clinical characteristics of adult patients who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had symptoms at least as early as 4 weeks after COVID-19 in México City between April 2020 and February 2021. A total of 179 were included. They answered questions to define chronic symptoms. The Sniffin’ Sticks Screening 12 test olfactory evaluation was performed. The diminish of QOL was defined by ≥10 points in the EuroQol visual analog scale between pre- and post-COVID-19, and each dimension of EQ-5D-5L test was evaluated. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Student t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and signed-rank test were used as required. A backward stepwise logistic regression analysis determined the factors associated with a decrease in QOL. All analyses were performed using R software version 3.6.3 (R Foundation). Results: In the multivariable analysis, post-COVID-19 pain/discomfort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.5 [1.66-9.68]; P =.01), anxiety/depression (aOR 13 [1.44-17.23]; P =.03), and persistence of ≥3 symptoms (aOR 2.6 [0.96-7.47]; P =.05) remained statistically significant associated with decreased QOL. Conclusions: Patients with long COVID-19 have decreased QOL mainly associated with pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and ≥3 persistent symptoms.

We examined the connectedness using the Quantile VAR and Wavelet Quantile Correlation method, indicating the existence of the partial connectedness among the selected assets. The connectedness among the assets changes due to change in global uncertainty caused by Covid-19 and Russia-Ukraine war. The green investment offers the hedging benefits to other green investment. Among all crypto assets, Dai serve as a good hedge for the green investment and other crypto assets. MCoP is best performing portfolio with Sharpe ratio, followed by MCP. However, the investment as per MCoP and MCP approaches increases the volatility of green assets. Further, the hedging benefits are varying with the changing global dynamics. None of the approach gives positive cumulative return and Sharpe ratio to the investors during the Russia-Ukraine war period. Our study has implications for the investors and portfolio managers with respect to portfolio framing and fund allocation. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Cryptocurrency; DeFis; Green Investment; Hedging; NFTs; Portfolio diversification","","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Agrawal S., Samadhiya A., Kumar A., Luthra S., Jain V., Adoption of green finance and green innovation for achieving circularity: an exploratory review and future directions, Geoscience Frontiers, (2023); Aharon D.Y., Demir E., NFTs and asset class spillovers: Lessons from the period around the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Research Letters, 47, (2022); Akkus H.T., Dogan M., Analysis of dynamic connectedness relationships between cryptocurrency, NFT and DeFi assets: TVP-VAR approach, Applied Economics Letters, pp. 1-6, (2023); Alam M., Chowdhury M.A.F., Abdullah M., Masih M., Volatility spillover and connectedness among REITs, NFTs, cryptocurrencies and other assets: Portfolio implications, Investment Analysts Journal, 52, 2, pp. 83-105, (2023); Ali F., Khurram M.U., Sensoy A., Vo X.V., Green cryptocurrencies and portfolio diversification in the era of greener paths, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 191, (2024); Ali S., Ijaz M.S., Yousaf I., Dynamic spillovers and portfolio risk management between defi and metals: Empirical evidence from the Covid-19, Resources Policy, 83, (2023); Ali S., Umar M., Gubareva M., Vo X.V., Extreme connectedness between NFTs and US equity market: A sectoral analysis, International Review of Economics & Finance, (2024); Allam Z., Bibri S.E., Sharpe S.A., The rising impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war: Energy transition, climate justice, global inequality, and supply chain disruption, Resources, 11, 11, (2022); Ando T., Greenwood-Nimmo M., Shin Y., Quantile connectedness: Modeling tail behavior in the topology of financial networks, Management Science, 68, 4, pp. 2401-2431, (2022); Antonakakis N., Cunado J., Filis G., Gabauer D., de Gracia F.P., Oil and asset classes implied volatilities: Investment strategies and hedging effectiveness, Energy Economics, 91, (2020); Arfaoui N., Naeem M.A., Boubaker S., Mirza N., Karim S., Interdependence of clean energy and green markets with cryptocurrencies, Energy Economics, 120, (2023); Arif M., Naeem M.A., Farid S., Nepal R., Jamasb T., Diversifier or more?

Passengers will re-plan the departure time, trip-chaining, and travel modes upon getting disruption information. Previous literature has limited research on this behaviour. Hence, we conducted a two-week survey during the COVID-19 pandemic, collecting 3,400 samples to analyze the joint choice behaviour of passengers in Chongqing, China, regarding departure time, trip-chaining, and travel modes. The 12 Cross-Nested Logit (CNL) models were established to explore the passengers’ joint choice behaviour in 12 different disruption scenarios. Analysis results reveal that on weekdays, passengers tend to choose immediate departure, simple trip-chaining, and bridging buses. On weekends and holidays, passengers prefer immediate departure when the disruption duration is less than 60 min. Whereas when the disruption duration exceeds 60 min, passengers are more inclined to postpone departure time, which suggests that operators need to pay more attention to the potential risk of an increased number of hindered passengers in these scenarios. The CNL structure analysis shows that the nest-specific coefficient for “trip-chaining” is the smallest in the weekday scenarios, indicating a high correlation between simple trip-chaining and complex trip-chaining. The results also imply that when exogenous variables change, passengers primarily adjust their departure times and travel modes. Notably, in the 12 models, the frequency of travel cost and waiting time being significant variables is higher than that of transfer counts, indicating that passengers are more sensitive to travel cost and waiting time. And elasticity analysis also shows that passengers are more sensitive to the waiting time for bridging buses. This study can help planners adopt effective strategies to maintain the reliability and sustainability of transportation systems. © 2024 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies","Cross-nested logit; Elasticity analysis; Joint travel behaviour; Metro disruption; Sustainable transportation; Urban transportation reliability","","","","","","Sichuan Science and Technology Innovation Seedling Project, (MZGC20230104); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72474184, 71704145, 72474185); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2682023ZTPY012); Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Innovation Research Team Project, (2020JDTD0027); International Science and Technology Collaboration Project of Sichuan Province, (24GJHZ0342)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71704145 , 72474185 ]; Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Innovation Research Team Project [grant number 2020JDTD0027 ]; Sichuan Science and Technology Innovation Seedling Project [grant number MZGC20230104 ]; International Science and Technology Collaboration Project of Sichuan Province [grant number 24GJHZ0342 ]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 2682023ZTPY012 ]. ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 72474184, 72474185]; Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Innovation Research Team Project [grant number 2020JDTD0027]; Sichuan Science and Technology Innovation Seedling Project [grant number MZGC20230104]; International Science and Technology Collaboration Project of Sichuan Province [grant number 24GJHZ0342]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 2682023ZTPY012].","Adele S., Trefond-Alexandre S., Dionisio C., Hoyau P.-A., Exploring the behavior of suburban train users in the event of disruptions, Transport.

It also brought about beneficial improvements in the industry. For example, remote meetings have become a part of everyday lives, and technology improvements have been expedited in unprecedented ways. As expected, companies worldwide with varying geopolitical conditions and regulations have implemented measures in response to the pandemic differently. For instance, most South Korean construction companies have continued working in person regardless of where they are employed (e.g., office or construction site), whereas many US companies conducted business entirely from home during lockdowns, at least in the initial pandemic stages. This study compares the pandemic-related changes implemented by construction companies located in two countries with vastly different pandemic-related contexts. Enabling this study is an online survey in November 2022 to construction experts working for various companies in the US and South Korea. The survey prompted participants to select changes that they underwent during the pandemic out of 21 presented options. In this analysis, we seek to compare how companies in the two countries implemented changes brought on by the pandemic. Findings showed that US construction companies had to adopt more changes (e.g., remote work, technological advancements) than South Korean companies as a result of economic and governmental circumstances. Such abrupt changes for overcoming challenges posed by the pandemic may have long-term benefits to construction companies and the industry overall. © Canadian Society for Civil Engineering 2025.","Change in construction industry; The pandemic; US and Korea","Change in construction industry; Condition; Construction companies; Industry change; Life improvement; Societal changes; South Korea; Technology improvement; The pandemic; US and korea","","","","","","","Wang D., Mao Z., A comparative study of public health and social measures of COVID-19 advocated in different countries.

Using this model, the second epidemic situation in a city was simulated. The impact of the epidemic’s spatial spread and quantitative growth was analyzed using the closure and control measures at different spatial scales (community closure and control, district and county closure and control). The study results show that the first 3 to 5 days after the appearance of an infected person is the best time for containment and control. The effects of the two modes are similar, so they are suitable for dealing with the single-point burst mode. Combined with the analysis results, suggestions are made for formulating closure and control measures after the epidemic rebounds. © 2025 The Author(s).","","COVID-19; Disease control; Burst-mode; Control measures;

The contributions from various scholars and practitioners present a range of theoretical concepts as well as innovative practice examples, inviting deep reflection on your own beliefs and attitudes. They examine and envisage different ways of working with and for young children, their families and communities for a better future. Chapters in this timely book include experts from around the globe examining key issues in early childhood education. The first section questions the increasing digitalisation in nurseries and pre-schools and its impact on staff members, parents and children. The second section focuses on workforce development, management systems and the role of parents in policymaking. The third section showcases innovative pedagogical approaches looking beyond widely accepted early learning goals, assessments and curricula to develop inclusive environments that foster all children’s development and learning. Lastly, the fourth section steps back from day-to-day practice and considers what concern for the environment, social justice and posthumanism means for early childhood education and pedagogy. This book will be a key resource for early childhood education and care practitioners, graduate students, policymakers and researchers facilitating the step from the here-and-now to revised future practice and policy that will enable all children to flourish. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Ute Ward; individual chapters, the contributors.

Coronavirus strains known as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) variants have undergone genomic changes. The severity of the symptoms, the efficiency of vaccinations, and the transmission capacity of the virus can be impacted by these alterations. Point-of-care diagnostic assays can identify particular genetic or protein sequences that are exclusive to each variety. Currently, ultrafast, responsive, and accurate antibody detection faces several challenges. Here, we outline the fabrication, implementation, and sensing performance benchmarking of an ultrafast (5 s) and inexpensive (0.15 USD) assay with label-free sensing of SARS-CoV-2 S (Spike)/N (Nucleocapsid) protein and other variants in real patient samples. A label-free DNA aptameric capacitive bio-sensing device was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our novel, cutting-edge bio-sensing device contains a Wooden quoits conformation structural aptamer (WQCSA)-based inter-digitated capacitor electronic (WQCSA-IDCE) system. WQCSA-aptamer was used as a switch-turn on response to achieve ultrasensitivity in the variable area of the SARS-CoV-2. The molecular beacon (MB) method was also used to measure the fluorescently colored SARS-CoV-2 S/N protein. These sensors can be used with several types of label-free DNA aptamers to act as rapid, affordable, and label-free biosensors for a variety of critical acute respiratory virus syndrome disorders. © 2024","DNA aptamer; Label-free sensing; Molecular beacon; SARS-CoV-2 variants sensing; Ultrafast sensing; WQCSA-IDCE","Coronavirus; Diagnosis; Vaccines; 2 propanol; acetone; magnetic nanoparticle; platinum; titanium; Aptamers; Biosensing; Dna aptamer; Label-free sensing; Molecular beacon; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant sensing; Ultra-fast; Ultrafast sensing; Wooden quoit conformation structural aptamer-IDCE; adult; aged; Article; atomic force microscopy; coronavirus disease 2019; cryoelectron microscopy; crystal structure; DNA sequence; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; human; hybridization; IC50; major clinical study; molecular beacon; polymerase chain reaction; scanning electron microscopy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; virus nucleocapsid; COVID-19","","2 propanol, 67-63-0; acetone, 67-64-1; platinum, 7440-06-4; titanium, 7440-32-6","GraphPad Prism 8.0.1, Graphpad; IM3570, HIOKI; Synergy  H1  BioTek EVOS  M5000, Biotek; Thermo  Nicolet  IS50  attenuated  total  reflection  Fourier-transform  infrared  spectroscopy, Thermo","Biotek; Graphpad; HIOKI; Thermo","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW; Korea Health Industry Development Institute, KHIDI; Kwangwoon University, KW University; Ministry of Education, MOE, (2018R1A6A1A03025242, 2018R1D1A1A09083353, 2022R1A2C209333612); Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (HU21C0086); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP","Funding text 1: This research was partially supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. 2018R1A6A1A03025242, 2018R1D1A1A09083353 and 2022R1A2C209333612), a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare and Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea (grant number: HU21C0086), and by a research grant from the Kwangwoon University, Korea, in 2023.; Funding text 2: This research was partially supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. 2018R1A6A1A03025242, 2018R1D1A1A09083353 and 2022R1A2C209333612), a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare and Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea (grant number: HU21C0086), and by a research grant from the Kwangwoon University, Korea, in 2019.
